What happens is it goes to the black apple screen for about 5 seconds and then flips to the ""slide to unlock screen"" and then back every 5-10 seconds. She only had the one backup which I made her create before we got the new iPhone.

1," I want to continue hooking up with my FWB, but my brother doesn't like it, and I don't want to stop, but he wants me to, and I don't know if it really is fair of him to ask me to","So I've been hooking up (no sex) with one of my brother's best (girl) friends for about two weeks now. We're essentially FWB, as in a few weeks I'll be leaving for college and she isn't yet. Anyways, both me and FWB have a wonderful arrangement, where neither of us gets attached to the other or anything. 

The problem is really with my brother, who is (about to?) go through a breakup with his girlfriend, who is, coincidentally, in my friend group. Anyways, he asked me today to stop hooking up with FWB, and I told him I'd think about it. His reasons were basically that ""I wouldn't mind if you were dating but it just makes me feel really awkward that two people I'm close with are using each other for pleasure."" 

Obviously, I don't really want to stop, as this is my last opportunity to have a summer fling/have some fun before I go to college. Besides, my brother's past two girlfriends have both been my friends too. (The one before his current girlfriend was originally my friend, but then we stopped getting along due to her bitchiness and two sidedness -- and eventhough I told my brother about it, he didn't break up with her. I didn't expect him to, but I'm just saying this because he can't use the excuse ""I'd do it if I were in your situation""). 

On the other hand, I'm off at college next year and I want to leave on a good note with him. I'm not sure how much this affects him though, and I feel like its unfair of him to ask me to stop hooking up with FWB. 

What do I do? Do I stop?

2, I'm dating a guy who has a very mellow personality and I'm not sure how to engage him when I feel like he's just a FWB who I happen to be exclusive with. How do I engage him? Are we just too different,"I'm dating a guy who's very hard for me to read. He has an extremely mellow personality, not passionate or heated or vocal about the way he feels. We've been dating for 6 weeks and I'm *guessing* he's into me because we have sex, he's extremely affectionate through touching and we make plans for the future. Plus he made it clear when we started dating that he's looking for a relationship. 

But...he hasn't vocally expressed any feelings for me and I can tell that he has trouble responding to things like ""I miss you"" or ""I wish I was with you tonight."" He's a great guy and I'd like to build a deeper bond with him, but I find myself losing interest because I don't feel that passionate, excited connection with him. To be honest, I feel like he's just a FWB who I happen to be exclusive with. 

I thrive off of conversation, and I need reaffirmations of how someone is feeling for me to be confident in our relationship. How do I engage him? Are we just too different in the way we communicate for this to work out? Thanks so much in advance!

3, I'm 26 and she is 24. We've been dating for 5 months and live together. I'm not sure if I want to marry her because I feel like I'm too young and she is ready to get married.,"We starting dating about 2 months before I unexpectedly moved to other side of the country. We kept talking over the phone every day and would visit each other. We did long distance for about 8 months until she got a job in my city. We live together now in a tiny place because she doesn't make much and we had to live together for her to afford living here. 

We went from long distance to living together in a tiny room but we've gotten along great. We've never had a fight in the 5 months she's been here. She would be the one except I find my self losing attraction to her. Its vain but I think I will regret being with her later in life. But on the other hand beauty doesn't last anyway. I'm really torn on this one because she's so great to me. 

I've never had a serious GF before her so I have no way to compare her to something else. She's incredibly nice and sweet to me. I can't imagine anyone loving me as much as she does but at 26 I feel like I'm too young to get married while she is ready.

4," I met a guy overseas, we have spent time together, but he is in the military and may be moving overseas soon, and I don't know how to handle the uncertainty of where we are going to be in the future.","I met a guy by chance over the holidays last year. We are from the same area but he was at the time living in a different state (he is in the Army), and has just moved overseas for 1-2 years with the military. 

We started as purely a fling considering everything. He is very ambitious and career-driven and has basically shut down the idea of a relationship at all until out of the Army. 

However, our connection has gotten stronger and we have spent several weekends together, including him buying me a plane ticket to see him, and a train ticket to his hometown to visit while he was spending time with family before leaving the country. I am planning to travel to where he is in about a month to see him, then travel on my own for a while. 

My issue is in handling the total uncertainty about where we are going. I have taken a lot of effort to not pressure him about us, not because I am afraid to, but because I prefer  to let things unfold organically and I don't think healthy relationships grow by force. I also don't necessarily WANT a long-distance relationship, so I'm not pushing it, but if he brought it up I would be willing to pursue it.

I'm just not sure how to proceed as I feel kinda stuck between two options: see where things go, which makes me feel anxious and nervous, yet is what I really want to do, or bring this up, which I don't really want to do right now, but might give me a bit of peace.

I liked him a lot and wanted to build something but he said that he wasn't ready for a relationship (as most guys are, I feel).

So we settle in being fuckbuddies and saw eachother sorta often. I went to become less attached and enjoy the time I was having. 

Then we kinda stop seeing eachother for about a month or so (not a concious desition by either one of us, it just happened). I called him to see what was up last week  and we hook up that day. It was fun as always but yesterday he text me and he just flat out told me he now has a boyfriend and he's happy and all. I'm not crying or anything but I am upset, more than I feel I should be about a non commited relationship and all.

6," I have a slightly crooked nose after a two year old accident. What are my options for correcting the injury now, two years after I incurred it? Correcting the breathing issues are my priority, but I'd also like to correct the slight crookedness","Age: 36, Sex: Male, Height: 5'7"", Weight: 150 lbs.

About two years ago, I was in a car accident and injured my nose. I'm not sure if it was technically broken, but it became swollen and slightly crooked. I visited an ENT in a timely manner and made an another appointment with that doctor to have my nose reset. However, I never actually went through with the procedure because of insurance issues. (My car and medical insurers both stated that it was the others' responsibility.)

Now, my nose still remains slightly crooked. I've also been having breathing issues and recurrent nosebleeds since the injury. I was told by the ENT I originally went to that I had a deviated septum that was worsened by the injury.

What are my options for correcting the injury now, two years after I incurred it? Correcting the breathing issues are my priority, but I'd also like to correct the slight crookedness if possible. My understanding is that plastic surgery could accomplish both of these things, but I'd like to keep whatever is done to a minimum and avoid that route. Is there anything else I should be considering?

Also, I didn't travel out of town for my company holiday party so we could go to hers and not be apart this weekend. On Saturday morning, she mentioned she was invited to go an all day event with friends on Sunday. I didn't want to be a wet blanket, so I told her she should go if she wanted. I was hoping she would have a similar perspective to me about priority and want to spend time together instead. She decided to go, and now I'm upset.

I think the main reason I'm upset is not so much that she went -- but that we clearly have different perspectives on priority of each other if it was such a clear cut decision for her. I've had relationship issues in the past regarding prioritization, so it's possible I'm overreacting, or that this is a valid problem.

We are both sophomores at the same university.

LDR for first year of college, spent summer in same town, I transferred schools this year. Almost a 2.5 year relationship, engaged for 1 year.

I know, first relationship- but I saw a future with her and planned accordingly around her. Had troubles over the summer, culminated in me breaking it off after Thanksgiving. We talk few days later, resume, she ends up leaving on New Years (our anniversary).

I've tried to reason or offer ways of fixing things (counseling). She refused, told me bluntly she loved me but I would be replaced...she would never come back. It's complicated because she views me as her previous ex- an obsessive guy who wouldn't leave her alone.
  My friends assure me that I have not acted like that at all. 

It sucks, it's made my friend group here awkward and everyday being here is a reminder. I'm working on dates with other girls and focusing on grades, not going too well.

11," Brother and Macy broke up, she has been a huge bitch to my brother for 5 years, but now they are getting back together and I don't know if I should tell my mom about it.","If this is the wrong place for this post, I'm sorry. Please direct me to a more appropriate subreddit.

But anyway, my brother, we'll call him Jack, has been in a relationship with a girl, we'll call her Macy, for five years. They began to date in high school as senior and freshmen. Once she graduated she got into a huge fight with her mom and ended up living with my brother, my mom, and I. 

Over these five years, Macy has ran Jack's life. She parties and lies and cheats on him, but because Jack is so nice he treats her like a princess. She continues to party without Jack and with other guys. She ultimately makes Jack hate his life.

 Fast forward to January 4th. Shit hits the fan and they break up. Jack's friends try to tell him that they shouldn't get back together because of all she has done. 

Jack doesn't believe them because in the beginning none of his friends liked Macy and tried to get them to break up, so Jack thinks that it's just a repeat. 

Jack had a ring halfway paid off and was going to propose on their anniversary in February.

They are still broken up, and everyone hates Macy except Jack and a few select others. He claims to love her and still wants her back. I am really bitter towards Macy because she hurt my brother in such a huge way. Macy is currently living with her mother, and I told my mother that I refuse to live in the same house as Macy. If her and Jack get back together, then I am out. 

My question is, should I try to tell Jack about everything? Should I try to get involved in this shitstorm? Part of me feels like he needs to make his own decisions, but how can I let him make one so self-destructive?

12, I'm confused as to whether the girl I like is telling me that she doesn't want to date right now or if she's telling me that the runway is clear for me to kiss her. I'm confused because she was flirty with me the,"So this girl and I have been hanging out and chatting a lot lately. We've known each other since last July but we didn't start hanging out until Decemberish for my 26th birthday party. She's 26 also. There's lots of flirting from what I can tell. She'd lean her head on my arm, give long deep hugs at greetings and departures, overall been touchy and compliments me a lot and says things like ""you're great."" (this is all within the last month)

I took all this as signs that I have the green light to make a move. The night I was planning on doing this she tells me she had just broke up with someone, so I held off, unsure whether she was telling me she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now or if she was telling me the runway is clear and I'm a go for landing a kiss on her. As I said, I held off to see how the rest of the night went and she was still flirty with me.

So we hang out a few days later on the weekend, we just talk and hang out for about an hour or two. I walked with her on her way to work and we were joking and laughing, so I figured this was a good time to put my arm around her and see how that floats. When I do that, she reminds me she had just ended a relationship and ""isn't available."" I was pretty dumbfounded to be honest. She continued to talk about how there was a mutual attraction going on, which I was pleased to hear, but I'm still confused about the whole thing.

Anyone know what I should do now? I like her quite a bit and would like to pursue something with her.

After much thought, I want to return to Australia and finish what I set out to do, but I don't really have very much cash at all whatsoever (I went there straight after graduating from uni).

I'm wondering how likely you are to be able to just turn up at the airport and find out what flights are leaving near enough then and there and (presuming there are spare seats) could you just book a seat at a significantly cheaper price than otherwise? It makes sense to me, because obviously the more empty seats, the greater the loss to the airline as they will have fixed overheads which are compensated from seats being utilised - beyond that, profit is profit so something is better than nothing, regardless of how small the offer.

Does this happen; does anyone have any examples of where they grabbed a bargain? I'd be flying from the UK, so I'm not sure if that makes any difference to the leniency of the airline to make such pricing compromises.

24," I turned down my first time with a girl because of how it should be treated, and now I'm worried that I may have missed a chance with a great girl because of my mindset on sex. When is it time to have sex with someone,","Lemme first preface this with we're both 19, been in the relationship for two weeks, and aside from this small concern have no other issues. Also, I'm still a virgin by choice. IE in I've had plenty of times to lose it but none have felt right as I grew up in a very traditional household and was taught that while you don't have to be married, you should love (or at least deeply care for) someone before having sex.

Now then, she has had a slew of past sexual relationships. She had a 3 year relationship in high school, and a 2 month fling in between then and college, and is now with me, so to her it's obviously less than a big deal. Well we were getting hot and heavy the other night and it came up, and we talked about it. She's ready to do the dirty, but me with my mindset of how sex should be treated, respectfully turned her down and I explained why. She understood but was obviously disappointed. So my question is: when do you deem yourself ready to have sex with someone? What was your first time like? To be honest, I'm mostly worried about ""wasting"" it away on someone undeserving, as the all the other chances I've past up till now have been good calls in hindsight.

25," I want to use a mutual fund to pay off debt, but my wife and I are not sure if it would be better to put the money into a downpayment on a house, or to pay off debt with the money from the mutual fund.","Hey /r/Personalfinance,

I'll give the numbers then explain my question.

**(Income)**

Annual income: $57,000 base salary (after 40 hours a week I get overtime)

Mutual Funds:  $64,000

**(Debt)**

Student Loans: $16,500 (6.8%)

Family Loan:   $4,000

**(Monthly Expenses)**

Rent: 	        $1,000

Everything else: $1,600

**(Goal)**

Down payment: $30,000

My wife and I are seeking to eliminate our debt and save up for a downpayment on a house. We're fans of Dave Ramsey/snowball and are looking for some advice.

I recently graduated from college, my wife will follow suit in a year. Before we were married, I payed for my college degree through work and loans. My wife's grandfather gave her an outstanding gift in the form of a mutual fund at a young age, in order to pay for her education. Following snowball, we are planning to put $1000 a month towards student loans and pay them off in about 2 years. After, we would then put the same amount of money towards a downpayment for a house, which would take another 3 years.

Alternatively, we are thinking about using the mutual fund to quickly pay off the remainder of our debt right now, allowing us to start on working on the downpayment. We've been forecasting a few different scenarios but are looking for some advice as to which option we should take.

26," I got high on spice (not weed) and my friends did too, but they didn't tell me because they didn't want me to get high on it. I became paranoid and almost went crazy because of it. Don't do it, it","So the other night I went out to a big party to accompany a friend that had to play music there. It's all going great, we stay there until 4 AM and then we head home with the host and his brother. While walking, he kept repeating that they must find a place to roll up a cigarette (him and his brother). At that point, I thought he wanted to roll up some weed because I saw him many times in the club smoking joints. I never thought they would smoke anything else than weed because he's a very succesful party host and I thought he was pretty damn serious. We get to a place and his brother starts rolling up. I couldn't pay attention to it because it was 4 AM and it was very dark. He lights it up takes about 4 hits and then he passes it over to my friend (he refused) and I. I take two huge hits thinking it's weed and I pass it over. Boom, 15 seconds later I realize that I'm high as fuck and something's wrong. I ask ""Yo, what weed is this?"". The host smirks and replies ""Yo, this ain't weed, it's some spice, right?"" *asks his brother*, where he nods. I immediately look over at my friend and I do a panicked face, he does aswell. This is the second time I smoke in my life, both times were by mistake (hopefully I learned my lesson for good this time). This shit is so fucked up that my heart was going fucking crazy, I couldn't think at all. The effect was nowhere near weed for me, it made me feel angry and I was hallucinating fucked up shit. I was lucky enough to stop at 2 hits, I would of ended up in the hospital otherwise. They smoked it like it was nothing... I became so paranoid that I thought they would pull out a knife and kill us because we were in an empty alley pretty much. I fucking lived a nightmare! Don't do spice for fuck sakes!

27," I love my girlfriend, but she wants to move across the country to pursue her dream job, and I don't know if I can handle an LDR, but she would be willing to try it if I moved with her.","Background info:

We met while she was still in college in the midwest. Last summer she interned in her dream career field in a city on the coast. She did not have a great job offer or enough money to stay there, and also loves me, so she moved back and has been living with me for 9 months.  Things are as good as they ever have been... she is my best friend and I could easily marry her.

The job she got after moving back to the midwest is not great with limited growth, and the opportunities in her desired field are few and far between here compared to on the coast. It's a very difficult field to break into, and she is younger, and has dreams. I believe she can be successful - her pedigree and experience is far above what mine ever has been.

I am in a wonderful job, and have the opportunity to work remotely. I now live near my parents, who are healthy, but I value that relationship. Leaving my group of friends would be difficult, but feasible. My priorities are: Girl, Job, Family.

I'd rather not have an LDR, but I'm not sure if I am ready to pack up and move across country. Because of our ages, I am established, have a great apartment, a dog, etc. Moving would be difficult and stressful.  She would just need to pack clothes.

I believe that if she has a dream, and she does, she should follow it. If I told her it would be too difficult or to ""settle"" for something here, it would be encouraging her to fail.  That said, she hasnt really tried to find anything better here, she's just saved money to move back to the coast. I don't believe she has been using me, though I can see how it could seem that way. We really do love each other.

Fuck me right?,"Over the weekend I went to a party hosted by a girl (let's call her Ashley) I work with.  Back story here: we dated like a month, I wasn't too into her and broke things off.  She stopped talking to me until recently started sending me emails at work and texting and then randomly invited me to the party Friday.

Drinking happened.  Ashley passed out pretty early and eventually everyone left but me and this other girl (let's call her Betty).  We were on separate couches talking and I drunkenly crawled over and we started making out.  She was into it but then stopped and said we shouldn't be doing this because Ashley still liked me.  I didn't really care because who wants to stop drunkenly making out so we did a little more and eventually we both left.  

Next day I got some pissed texts from Ashley.  Turns out her brother saw us making out and told her.  Then more pissed texts from Betty because Ashley is mad at her.  I'm not really upset that I upset Ashley because we aren't a thing, the real fuck up here is that I probably ruined a legit shot with Betty because of all of this.

29," I get frustrated when my girlfriend is upset and frustrated that I get frustrated. It makes me feel guilty and bad, but I feel bad for her and frustrated that she's frustrated with me. It makes me frustrated and frustrated and frustrated.","Potentially a very petty relationship issue, but it's been driving me crazy and I want to know if I'm hugely in the wrong to be upset.

Long story short - we're away from each other at least for the summer as I have a job out of state. I am constantly busy with work, I'm not lonely and I am pretty happy. She is pretty bored and extremely lonely and extremely sad. 

We call each other nightly, typically after I'm exhausted from work. Sometimes the conversations are okay, but usually it's nothing besides her being extremely upset, voicing her loneliness, usually crying, something having a complete breakdown. I'm the type of person that tried to help, and she's the type of person that doesn't accept help. It's very frustrating to me when she is upset, I talk about the positive light, and she snaps back with how I'm wrong and everything is terrible. I feel like I can do nothing to help and I hate it. She beats herself up and I feel completely powerless.

I get SO frustrated that, after an exhausting day when I want nothing more than to come home and unwind, I end the evening by listening to her cry and complain and beat herself up and I can't do a thing about it. And then I get even MORE frustrated BECAUSE I'm frustrated over it. It makes me feel so guilty and like a horrible person that my girlfriend is so upset and I'm useless in the situation. I love her and it feels terrible to see her so upset, but I'm happy and when I try to project that on her it gets shot down. I try to be understanding of her situation, but I still end up frustrated and upset... and it always makes me feel guilty. 

Am I crazy? Should it be my responsibility, no matter what, to console her endlessly even when it upsets me?

I asked her if she's racist and she said no, but she's saying how she doesn't want other races to be in our house renting 1 room because she's afraid of the room getting trashed and destroyed like what parents think what would happen if you leave a few kids alone in a house for the whole day. The problem is, I asked her for proof of this happening and all she's saying is that her friend that also gave rent to tenants who apparently did drugs, had a lot of alcohol, unfriendly, had their place trashed, but I only said that it is just only ONE incident. What she is saying is that she believes that most Canadians (in this instance) would do this just because of ONE incident. So she is basically giving a bad impression about Canadians because of this one event. Her saying this is literally almost the same thing (to a smaller extent) as people saying that Muslims are bad just because a few stupid people decided to do 9/11 when in reality, Muslims aren't actually bad at all. She later proceeds to tell me that ""I don't understand this topic and that i'll know more when I'm older"" as she does with every topic to make me stop negotiating with her because she knows I'm right but doesn't want to admit it.

47," Wife has been having sex with guys at her home with the kids present, concerned for her safety and the kids safety. What can I tell her and what can I do to make sure the kids are safe?","In January I separated from my wife after 10 years of marriage, we've got 6 year old twins and they now live half the time with her, half with me. 

She's recently got into hooking up with guys via app based social networks (Blendr I think), she's not interested in a relationship but just wants to have fun and sex. Usually she'll have the guys come over to her place when I've got the kids. When she first started doing this, a month ago, she confided to me that she was concerned about her safety, I suggested she consider using a different location than her home because it also exposes the kids to any risk, but she went ahead and met guys at her home anyway.

Last night she told me she currently has 4 guys on the go, one came over the night before and she had sex with him whilst another was hiding in the garden watching through the window. Just to be clear the kids are with me whilst this is all happening (as far as I'm aware).  

Now for me it's a bit challenging to hear all this because of my history with her: it's still relatively recently that we separated, we rarely had sex and she never orgasmed. So it's clear she's now exploring her sexuality and enjoying her freedom, which she has every right to.

When she tells me about this stuff I just get floored by it, full of my own feelings. She's telling me all this and kind of asking ""is this OK?"".

So should I be concerned about her and the kids safety? What advice can I give her? 
I'm thinking the biggest risk is that one of these guys turns up uninvited and won't leave. Luckily she lives on a street with a lot of good people she could call on for help.

One idea I've had is to send her [this article] which talks about responding to threats of violence.

This girl is my","Ok, so I've posted before about introducing my SO to my parents, and about a sketchy dude who apparently wanted to get in my pants via the internet, but this one is about my best friend in the whole world.

Back story:
She and I have known each other 2 and a half years, ever since we were randomly assigned roommates freshman year of college. We are now juniors and live in singles right next door to each other. She has a history of eating disorders and self harm, and after a year and a half of me telling her to, is now seeing a psychiatrist and has prescriptions for anxiety and depression.

She recently broke up with her boyfriend of a year (M20) and is now dating a new guy (M29) (Not sure if this is relevant, but hey, it's a recent change in her life).

Current situation:

She's recently run out of drugs and won't be seeing her therapist until Thursday. The only person she trusts enough to talk about this to is me. Over the past two days I have had to counsel her through panic attacks and freak outs where she is convinced she is a burden on me and worthless. I've noticed that her wrists were in bandages and asked her if she wanted me to take her knives away, she said yes and they are now hidden in my room. 

Basically my question is, how the hell do I get through the next four days until she can see her shrink? I have exams and papers to write, but I'm terrified that she's going to do something...stupid and I don't know what to do. 

This girl is my best friend and I'm pretty sure I'd go to pieces if something happened to her. I love her too much for her to have an accident.

Also, it should be noted that she has tried the counseling services provided by the school and hates them. She only talks to me or her therapist. She won't even talk to her parents or sister cause she doesn't want them to think her crazy.

50," I met a girl on Omegle and we have been talking for months. She lives in Philadelphia and I live in NYC. What do I do? I really like her and don't want to lose her, but I don't want to keep","One night in late June (two months ago) I decided to screw around on Omegle late at night. I somehow met a girl and we talked for hours. Got each other's skypes and subsequently talk endlessly for weeks. See each other in person a few times, and get along perfectly. I've never connected this well with someone (guys included), ever. I've been fine with girls so I never thought I'd met a girl online (and omegle of all places). We admitted we have strong feelings for each other.
Here is the problem: I am going into senior year of HS outside NYC and she is going to freshmen year of college in Philadelphia. She's been hesitant to talk about a relationship (neither of us have been in one) but also says she's never wanted to be in one until she met me. So I know this is a general question, but what do I do? It's not healthy for me to feel this way about a girl 100 miles away, but my heart aches at the thought of cutting it off because I've never met a girl like her. I know she feels the same way because we are very open. Her main objection is she wants someone to hold her at night, and that me not being around would be tough on her. I'm not very jealous, but the thought of her hooking up with other guys kills me (even though she's only been to first base once other than me). Thanks for any advice.

I guess it's because my body was on a different routine than usual, but I feel shitty. I think I have an ear infection (possibly two, but one is significantly worse). My ears have been stopped up and waxy, and I've just been miserable. The plane ride home was probably the single most painful experience of my life. It felt like there was a bottle of wine in my head and the cork was trying to shoot out of my ear. I was holding back tears the entire way. It hurts to touch my ear, and there's always a lot of pressure in it. That makes sleeping a pain. I've had constant headaches that add to the ear aches. Today, my temperature oscillated between 100 and almost 103. I'm trying to keep hydrated, but that's made me have to pee just about every hour. I haven't really been able to eat, but somehow I am still sitting on the toilet with horrible diarrhea. 

I've been feeling really bad, and last night made it worse. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt wet all over. I was barely awake, so I assumed it was sweat and fell back asleep. When I got up today, there was a big wet spot in my pajamas and on my bed. There really wasn't any doubt at that point. I had wet the bed. I felt horrible. I felt disgusting and betrayed by my own body. It's almost one in the morning now, and I'm afraid to go to bed. I'm worried that I'm going to piss myself in my sleep again. I'm worried I'm going to have to wake up again feeling ashamed and disgusting.

Basically, ever since classes started last week we had been hanging out everyday, both in my room and in her room, one-on-one and with her friends. The interest seemed mutual: I'd propose something to do one day, she'd suggest something the next day. 

Friday night, we were sitting on her bed watching TV alone in her room, door closed, and I took a risk of sitting close to her so our legs, arms, and sides were touching. She didn't move away or say anything, and I didn't try anything more, but I took it to be an encouraging sign.

She had invited me two weeks ago (we were apart during spring break) to watch a movie with her Saturday night (yesterday) in her dorm room, and I was really looking forward to it--I was going to use it as an opportunity to ask her out, and gauge her interest.

We spent yesterday afternoon and evening making food to eat during the movie, and when we met up later that night to finish cooking and then go watch the movie, she suddenly told me she couldn't watch the movie that night because she needed to go to Easter mass early the following morning--she's not super-religious, but felt obligated to attend.

The cancellation was really confusing and frustrating for me, and I can think of two reasons why she would have cancelled:

1. She actually had to go to Easter mass and needed to sleep.
2. I made her uncomfortable the previous night when I sat close to her, and so she cancelled the movie to prevent anything more from happening.

65," Parents have large back yard, but no fence. Want to fence in their 50 pound dog to allow her to run and play, but not get out of the yard. What is the best material to use and how much would it cost to do so","My parents recently moved to a semi-rural area, which allows them quite a bit of space. They have a large lot behind their house, however between the house and this lot is a circular driveway, car port and shed. They also have a large front lawn, which they have considered fencing in to allow their year old Boxer-Hound mix some room to run. However, it runs straight up against a road which has  a fairly fast speed limit that is often ignored. 

Due to this location, lack of side walks, and the health status of my folks, taking this energetic young pup on long walks is unlikely. I have been trying to devise some manner for them to fence in or contain their pup in their back lot, so she can get the exercise she deserves. However, the resources to this with are quite limited.

Their pup is about 50 pounds and loves to jump, so the classic chicken wire may be to flimsy. Also, backing up to their lot is the lot of some neighbors who have dogs trained to be vicious and have proven that they can jump their own fence. So, I'd like to devise a way to protect their dog, allow her to have a happier life and do it in an affordable manner.

She told me she was going home to tell her parents about her problems. Instead, she flew to Milwaukee to have sex with a guy she met at the Final Four in early April. Pretty classy stuff. I found out because I felt like something was wrong and looked through text messages. Her mom completely supported her in the endeavor (paid for tickets, cute clothing, etc.). Me and her signed a lease two weeks ago (after it happened) and were supposed to leave for Europe on May 25th. I'm working to fix those situations. I need help on knowing what to do. She was my life and now I'm lost. I can always blame her eating disorder and depression on her choices, but she is the one that did this. I don't think I can ever forgive her.

TL;DR: I broke up with my ex, moved out of her place, and feel","A brief explanation of the relationship. In my recent relationship my ex gf said small things she didn't like about me caused her to fall out of romantic love with me. I tried for three months to save the relationship while emotionally beating myself up trying to win her love back (which won't happen again). She was the first women I have lived with for relationship reasons.

The last three months she changed and I convinced my self I could make it better. I should have left. We finally mutually broke up Sunday and I slept at her place (our old place) but in separate rooms on Monday. I officially started moving back in yesterday with my previous roommate.

After work my roommate popped in some COD, I ordered some pizza, and we just had bro time. I am not going to lie and say I didn't think about her but I did complete the purge of pictures of her/us from my facebook, instagram, and deleted her phone number.

It felt like I was ripping a small piece of my heart every picture but felt oddly satisfying when it disappeared. During this time of just doing my own thing I felt a happiness that I haven't felt in a while.

I woke up this morning not having to see her and be reminded, and I felt refreshed. I am still having random thoughts, but they are slowly losing how much control they have on me.

I think a big contributor of this is being prepared and trying to handle it as an adult. For the first time I am expressing my emotions, talking to friends about the situation, and I even let myself cry it out.

It really does get better.

69," I met a guy who was an actor in Laos, but turns out he was a character actor on *Sons of Anarchy* and killed his landlady and himself today. I was sad. That is all.","I was backpacking in Laos with a friend in 2009 when we met this cool guy called Johnny. 

Johnny was great company. We talked about traveling, backpacking and how he always liked to stay one night in a five-star hotel in each country -- even though he otherwise only spent 10 bucks / day.  

It was the second day of the three of us hanging out when we found out what Johnny did for a living. He was an actor. 

He had appeared in *O.C.* and *Alien vs. Predator II* as well as an Andy Richter sitcom. He also told us that he was born in LA and even once saved Mischa Barton after she'd dropped in a pool in a party.

We swapped emails and I figured I'd like to meet Johnny when I'll someday visit Los Angeles from Finland (that's where I live).

That day never came, but today I found out about this from a Finnish newspaper: 

It turns out that 

1) Johnny was one of the main characters in *Sons of Anarchy* (a show I never watched), 

2) he has dated Katy Perry since we met -- *and* 

3) it seems that he's just killed his 81-year-old landlady as well as himself.

TL;DR: I have no idea how to talk","I'm currently 18, and its been almost two years since I was last in a relationship. That period has been a difficult time for me in that respect, as I had a difficult breakup (dumped by text with absolutely no warning or justification by a girl I really liked, who ended up with someone else within a week or two) and then spent several months (probably close to a year) in a really weird and probably quite unhealthy infatuation with one of my absolute best friends at the time, who rejected and 'friendzoned' (I hate that term, but I don't know what else to use) me in the nicest way possible, but then went on to start dating another of my best mates.

All of this really destroyed my self image and confidence with the opposite sex completely. Its something I've been trying to work on a little, but when I finally built up the confidence to ask a girl out a few months ago, I realized I'd totally misread the signals, and ended up having a really awkward coffee with a girl because I didn't have the confidence to make it clear that I was asking her out on a date, not just as a friend.

I have a great social life otherwise, and I have plenty of (male and female) friends, but I've reached a point where I find it hard to imagine anyone finding me attractive. Physically, I'm very tall/skinny and I have long hair, and although I'm personally pretty happy with my appearance, and think I've created a style which reflects my personality well, I've convinced myself that these traits are the reason I don't seem to have any success with women.

Here's the situation:
I was let go from my job last year, due to the economy, and have been living off my savings.  I met a guy around the same time, thought he was great - smart, kind, attractive, etc.  About 6 months later he quit his job and needed a place to stay.  I took him in and have been providing free rent, food, transportation, and entertainment ever since.  He claims he is looking for a job, but I can't help but feel taken advantage of.  When I try talking to him about it, he gets very defensive and says he will pay back every cent.

The money isn't that big of a deal to me.  It would be nice if he actually paid me back, but I don't really expect it.  I feel trapped because all of his stuff is in my apartment - many, many boxes - and he doesn't have any money, a car, or a place to go.  

He isn't a bad person, and I do care about him, but I'm ready to move on.  I'm starting to feel more like a mother than a girlfriend.  I don't want to just tell him to GTFO, so how do I get rid of him?

I was into my second year of college when my mum suggested i go for a dental checkup, I was all to eager to go since my day to day college life was boring me... so that weekend me, my elder sis and my mum got an appointment with the dentist who worked at the same hospital my mum worked at. 

I Fucked Up and asked to go first. Cleaning and a little look around showed that I had 7 cavities plus a front tooth I had broken in a cricket accident. The dentist suggested that I could get them all filled and get the front tooth fixed in one sitting, right then and there. I wish to inform y'all here that this was my second dental experience, since i had a tooth extraction when I was 6. I was expecting the dentist to give me something to K.O. me or at least something to dull the pain I might feel. None of that BS happened, he pulled on his surgical mask and some big sunglasses and asked me to look at his face while he was drilling into my cavities one at a time. I was thinking,""I CAN'T SEE YOUR FUCKING FACE!!!!! AND I'M IN A LOT OF FUCKING PAIN"". So i shut my eyes and didn't open them until the drilling was done. I was writhing on the chair like an alien was about to pop out of my fucking stomach. I thought I was into the clear when the drilling was done. NOPE!!!! He fucking sprayed hot water/steam onto my exposed nerves to clean them out. Then the pain stopped, but I was waiting for an opportunity to give him some pain. He was adjusting some rubber clamps in my mouth to make sure i don't damage my teeth while they're being filled, and that's when opportunity struck like winning the lottery. His finger was between my upper and lower molars trying to adjust the clamp, and I bit down like a shark. He screams like a girl, I let go and look at him like nothing happened.

What should I do now that I know about her feelings for me and that she has had feelings for","Hi! I didn't really know where to post this but I am looking for some different insights and possibly pieces of advice from you guys. So basically, I've met this girl, let's call her *Emma*, on a night out over a year ago when she went to a bar with her best friend *Stephanie*, a gorgeous but very naïve and immature girl. We got along really well and I instantly began to like both of them, so we exchanged numbers. Sure, Emma is really cool and we clicked very quickly but I only saw her as ""friend"", whilst Stephanie was more attractive. That's why Stephanie and I started to hook up casually for a couple of weeks, but we never thought about actual dating. Time went by and all three of us continued hanging out together. I discovered that Emma is a really nice person and a very good friend who listened to me every time I had something to get off my chest. Stephanie on the other hand, is a very attractive, young woman but she was subject to extreme mood swings, a real diva and full of insecurities. The sex was fun but her behaviour was a huge turn off for me and I started to feel annoyed by her. Therefore, I limited my contact to Stephanie after a while. However, Emma and I remained good friends and we would still see each other every now and then. Yesterday, I talked to a mutual friend of ours. She has told me that Emma has had feelings for me for a really long time. It started even before things ended between me and Stephanie. Possibly even before Stephanie and I started to hook up. We've slept on the same couch together, I have massaged her and I have told her very personal things. I basically see Emma as one of my closest friends now, there is no romantic interest in her. I like her very much and don't want to ruin our friendship. But knowing that she has had feelings for me for such a long time, makes it really difficult for me. My question is: Now, that I know that she has feelings for me, what should I do? Should I talk to her about it? Should I pretend that I don't know about it and ignore it completely? It makes our friendship so awkward now.

Should I give all of them at once (including the big one) or wait on the big one until after his birthday (when we have more time","Hi all, so, I know this isn't really an issue of any sort but it's driving me crazy just the same, and I could really use some opinions! I'll be brief.

My boyfriend's birthday is coming up in the next few weeks. We're both starting school up again on the day of his birthday, so I won't be able to really be with him on that specific day - for that reason, I have 5 days beforehand to give him his gifts. I got him 5 things - and the last of the 5th is really, really big. Not size wise, but just a really big deal. And it's been DRIVING ME NUTS having to keep this secret for even just a month, so I want to give it to him as soon as possible! But also I want to make it special. Gah. 

Anyway, so he's having a party with friends and it will be the first of 6 days I will be spending with him. So I thought about just giving him all of his gifts then. One of them he sort of has to open on the day of the party - but he claims he'd rather open them all at once. So, basically, I'm just wondering if I should just give him all of his gifts 6 days before his birthday (including the special one) or give him all of his gifts and then wait on the last one until we have more time alone (aka not a partying night, just me and him or something). I can't decide and trust me, I know this is so ridiculous, but it's literally making me so anxious not knowing what to do. And I just want him to know already so I can stop keeping this secret! 

Clearly I'm terrible with surprises. Any advice? All gifts together on one day, or should I set the big one aside and give him that one later? 

Thank you!!

75, Parents want me to have a family party and a big party for my friends on my birthday. I really don't want to and don't know how to tell them to stop making me feel uncomfortable about it.,"So I will be turning 21 in a little over a month's time. Where I'm from it's quite common to have a big party to celebrate your 21st and as everyone is expecting me to throw a party and I'd like to as I really enjoy hosting. However this time it's a bit different. Where I'm from it's normal to invite all the extended family to your party, but thanks to my parents I have little to no relationship with any of my relations and so my mother proposes I have a smaller family party in the house for all the relations and then a big party for my friends somewhere else.

I don't know how to tell her I really don't want that. When I was younger I assumed it was cause we were so little we were never included in any family events (mother would attend, dad would stay and look after us) but even now my mother refuses to include me even though I'm an adult so I see most of my mother's family maybe once, twice a year. My dad's family is just as bad as my parents hide so many things about me and my siblings from them (I'm not allowed tell them I drink (I am legal in my country) , that I've a boyfriend etc). It's incredibly frustrating having to lie all the time. This is why I don't want the family party as I don't want to spend an evening hiding parts of my life and sitting in the corner being terribly uncomfortable.

The party with my friends is similar. My mother is insistent on her my dad and my younger siblings attending but I really don't want it. My mother has a tendency to make me feel incredibly self-conscious about my behaviour and not disappointing her and I know I'll spend the whole evening stone cold sober sitting with them listening to my mother make mean remarks about the friends she doesn't like, when I should be having fun at my own party.

My parents keep bringing this up the party and I know this sounds like a very petty and self-centred problem but it is causing me anxiety and I'd rather just ignore my birthday entirely just so I don't have to go through with it

She very much dislikes me going out with my friends, which are all male. She never wants to go out anywhere with me and I prefer to go out places. We have different ideas about money, and therefore she hates it whenever I spend my money that I have have earned. She never thinks anything is her fault. I very much dislike her family.

So back in the beginning of this school year I met a freshman (I'm a sophomore) that goes to my school and began to like her. She was always too busy and I ended up meeting another girl who became my first girlfriend. Since then we've broken up and I have started talking to the freshman again. A couple nights ago we were texting and she admitted that she has feelings for me still, and I told her that I use to like her as well. 

The thing is, I've had two girlfriends since I liked her, and I no longer feel the way I use to about most girls I know, her included. Sure, I'm attracted to them, but I don't feel a real connection between us.

Anyway, the freshman and I went to a carnival together and I kissed her while we were on the Ferris wheel. We spent the rest of the evening together having fun and making out, and at the end of the night I walked her home and told her that I like her. I didn't lie - I do *like* her, but I just don't feel a strong connection between us. She's beautiful and has a great personality but I no longer *feel anything*. Her personality doesn't seem to match mine, and to me that is the most important thing (it was the reason my first girlfriend and I broke up; we saw the world from completely different perspectives).

I had a very similar situation with another freshman girl at my school a few months ago: I met her at my school's freshman/sophomore formal, we hooked up, I began to like her, but then all of a sudden I didn't want her to be my girlfriend, and had to break her heart.

I feel like an asshole, but right now I just want to meet new people, have some fun with some girls, and hopefully meet someone along the way that I do have a lot in common with and that I truly have feelings for.

I don't know why my boyfriend just lost his nerve, it's unlike him really, I've never seen him even be slightly upset but he just stood up and very passive aggressively said he'd ""best leave lest I keep disturbing your friends"" then took out his wallet gave me like 50 euro and told me to get myself and them a cab home.

85," Wife stopped giving oral after marriage, says she doesn't enjoy it and doesn't want to do it anymore. What should I do? Get over it I guess? I feel like this is negatively impacting my view on the relationship, making me resentful","Yes, I know I'm not 'owed' oral, etc etc. I enjoy giving oral to my wife and she actually enjoys it quite a bit, insisting on it regularly, but the frequency of her reciprocation has decreased to nothing however. We've been together almost 3 years, got married about a year and three months now. After our honeymoon it has decreased until about seven months ago when it has completely stopped. I've asked her about throughout these times and she she sort of hymned and hawed and said she'd try more, just didn't feel like it right now, etc. 

Relatively recently, she's fully said that she didn't enjoy it at all and did not want to do it anymore. She agrees that she should have made her views well know but thought that would make her less desirable. However, she will not continue it in any capacity, she just doesn't want to do it and doesn't want to pretend like she does anymore. I'm a pretty staunch feminist and told her of course she didn't need to do anything she wasn't comfortable with and she didn't owe me anything. But where does that put us now? I actually like oral on the same level of sex if not a little more (extremely rare I guess?). I kind of slightly resent that she was doing it all along even though she didn't enjoy it as well. And that she didn't tell me at all this is what she was feeling all this time. I'm sure there are guys out there that don't like oral as well, just like there are girls out there that enjoy oral. 

What should I do? Get over it I guess? I feel like this is negatively impacting my view on the relationship, making me resentful and questioning the relationship. I'm not sure where to go from here.

86," I met a guy when I was at my worst, we fell in love, but now I feel like I gave up everything for nothing and I want to try again, but I don't know if I can handle the pain again.","I met him a few years ago when I was stil legally married, i had just broken up with my husband and I was at my worst. I cried, felt sad all the time,  and wanted to kill myself, and then he came along (ill refer to him as J). No weird intentions, he was respectful, cooked for me and was real sweet, finally after maybe a month of such he confessed his love for me and I knew it was sudden, but I too felt it and said nothing.

My break up was however fresh, and my ex asked to give things a try. And so out of feeling that maybe I was being taken advantage off because i felt weak emotionally, I walked away from J and went back to my ex husband. Months went by and I could only think of him when I was with my ex husband. 

I broke it off and stayed away from J for a whike, he refused to talk, hear, speak or anything of the sort. I understood Js feelings, I had abandoned him once. Then suddenly he speaks to me again, I hear his voice, I feel his warmth and ao after a few month of being persistent and semi dating, we move in. 

Well it started out strong, we were very different but fuck, did i give up everything just to hear the sun tell me he loved me. And then, there was difficulties... I lost a baby and aat at the waiting room alone in tears with mo hand to hold, but we pulled through. And then he lost his job but as sad as J would get we pulled through, but pretty much everything became difficult and weird from both of us. 

We couldnt communicate, we both made little efforts things were falling apart and I got impatient and I called it off.. He begged and crued for me to stay, said he woukd try and so we try. Three days go by and yes things are betterish, but he is paranoid and it feels force. I loose my temper and I call it off, quit.

But here it is not even weeks later, my heart is tearing and cant atop crying...I hope he reads this I already miss his face, i already miss his voice.

88," Boyfriend and I moved back in with his mom, she makes us unhealthy meals and doesn't seem to care that we're eating unhealthy. Not sure how to talk to her about it again. Any suggestions on how to talk to her about it again","I (26F) and my boyfriend (27M) of 3 years recently moved back in with his parents. Prior to that we had been living together for the past 2 years. At the time, when we first moved in together I noticed that my boyfriend had a few unhealthy eating habits. So together, we both started eating healthier and I eventually got him on a diet. And even got him to start exercising with me daily. Everything was great when we were living together. We have a wonderful relationship and I love him a lot. 

But due to his job being super stressful he finally made the decision to leave his current job and move back to the state where he is originally from. We didn't have enough time or money to find a place of our own so in the mean time his mom offered to let us stay with her until we got back on our feet. I love his mom dearly, she's a great person. But the one thing that I cannot get over is her cooking. She makes us dinner almost every night and each time its loaded with saturated fats, tons of cooking oil, butter and super greasy. We haven't really had enough money to buy our own food so we pretty much eat whatever is in the house. Not to mention that my boyfriend has fallen into his old eating habits and is gaining back weight he's lost. I've tried talking to him about it but it doesn't seem to bother him in the least. I've mentioned a few times to his mom that we're used to eating fresh fruits and veggies but she just sort of brushes it off. 

I've even tried to cook a few meals that we're used to eating and only for her to intervene and 'tweak' my cooking by adding unnecessary fatty things like vegetable oil. I've been upping my exercise routine but I'm still gaining weight because there isn't anything healthy to eat. I cant necessarily turn away her cooking either because I don't want to be rude. I know this might sound like a petty problem but its been really getting to me lately at how unhealthy their lifestyle is. I'm not even sure how to bring this up again with his mom. Any suggestions??

Is there any chance of me having any other genetic issues, and if so, what kind of issues are common in the general population (or at least in the UK).","I´ve become curious about this recently. I, unlike many of my friends cannot roll my tongue. From what I remember of genetics in biology at school, rolling your tongue is the dominant gene, so I´ve got the less common recessive gene, which explains why i´m one of the few that can´t! 

Unlike most of my friends, I can flare my nostrils at will. (it also happens if I take a deep breath through my nose.) I have no idea how this is controlled, genetic or not, but I  like to see how many of you are able to do this too.

Also I have had a total of three extra teeth in my pernament set (as opposed to milk/child´s teeth). these include:

* 2 extra wisdom teeth which are burried in my jaw. the dentist assures me that they don´t come down. 

* 1 extra tooth between my top incisors (wikipedia tells me this is a conical supernumerary) This was removed. 

Also also, my sister has an extra bone in her foot for some reason. It´s small, but has caused her some pain playing certain sports and was picked up on an x-ray. 

It would be interesting to know if things like this are more common than thought, or if i´m just a bit of an oddity o_0

She also has a very messy room that she has been cleaning for over 2 years with no dents made. I can tell she's frustrated with where she is in life, but seems stuck and hasn't made actual strides towards achieving her goals. She is the oldest of 3 children, and both are moved out and one is married. 

When we first started dating, we both talked about how we had broken up with people who didn't have life plans/weren't pursuing their dreams.

During the school year, I'd often have to do homework and shiz at absurd times because of unfortunate and long naps I took. Today was finally the tipping point, though. I've been trying to make plans to go to the movies with a good friend for a few weeks now, but something always came up for her when we were going to go.

I call her right after I read the text message, and she says she's at the theater already.

Me and her keep in touch, hang out from time to time, and I figured out she kinda liked me (I can read some body language). This summer camp was pretty lame and we've been together for a few days until she broke up with me saying: "" she doesn't know what she wants and I want a serious relationship"". 

I felt very hurt when she did this , especially because she did it with messages instead of telling me in face (she said she had a very busy day and she couldn't). I got angry then she got angry and now I don't know what to do.

In my junior year in high school, we had this classmate who we liked to pick on - I'll call him Remy just for the sake of clarity. Although he was friends with all the guys in our class, we enjoyed picking fun at him and he never got pissed off at us, so it was all some good, friendly banter among us.

One day, one of the dudes in our class decides to try and pull on Remy's hair. A good few strands came off, but not too much to alarm us. I join in on the fun and pull a bit of his hair out, too, and one of the guys makes a joke saying that he might have cancer. It became a regular thing after that, pulling out his hair and suggesting he had cancer.

Fast forward to around three years later, and I get a text from one of our mutual friends. Remy's in the hospital after doctors discovered a large tumor in his head. I'm told Remy already has Stage 4 cancer, and the tumor was there for a few good years but wasn't found until that time.

I'm hoping it's a cruel joke, but word gets around to people from our school that he indeed does have cancer and his health is going downhill at a fast rate. Some benefit events get organized to support him too, and our mutual friend gives me updates all the time about how his health is doing. Remy eventually comes to a point where he doesn't know some of his friends and stays in the hospital for an extended amount of time. I never got to see him during this time though.

Fast forward a few months more, and he finally succumbs to it. I go to his wake, and the first time I see him in years is when he's dead after battling cancer.

Felt a little bad, and some people joked that he died because my classmates and I made fun of him. I know it's not my fault that he had cancer, I don't blame myself for that, but I wish I knew better than to make a joke like that.

Nope. The problem is, he's an immigrant from China and I guess his family isn't real keen on anything but traditional/herbal remedies. When he told me that I said kind of jokingly, ""Well it's not working!"" I think he got that I wasn't really kidding, but brushed the issue off.

Anyway, the vet recommended we do a battery of tests including an ultrasound and keep our cat there for a few days, which would cost somewhere in the region of $1,600.00. I love my cat very much but we simply can't afford to pay that much. They have given me an appetite stimulant, an amino complex, a cat pheromone diffuser and some high protein intense food to feed him. I've been feeding him with a syringe but I'm basically forcing it down his throat (it doesn't seem like the appetite stimulant helped at all). At least he's not dehydrated. Does any one have any recommendations for things I can put in the food to make it more palatable or anything else what would be helpful?

TL;DR: I met a girl at a party, ended up having sex with her","Basically I was in a year-long relationship til about two months ago. Reason for breakup was that she thought I liked her housemate/friend and I eventually I admitted it (no cheating or anything). I loved my girlfriend and feelings for the housemate were nothing in comparison but I guess it was pretty untenable by that point.

Anyway, I hadn't seen either of since then until I was at their house last week. I was very drunk (to try and cope with seeing my ex again - usually I have to just have no contact to get over stuff), and ended up going home with someone who works with the housemate (first one night stand ever, I am not that kind of guy).

Feel like an idiot for doing that because I can't stop thinking about the housemate now, and I guess I've ruined any possible future chance with her?

Is there a problem with the wiring in the light fixture? Is there a problem with the wiring","Ok, so last night the lights in my bedroom went out. They've been there since I bought my house (first house woo!). All the lights went out too, so I assumed a bulb blew. So I trudged into my cellar and flipped the lights fuse switch. (after I had made sure to turn off the light switch in my bedroom)

When I went back into my bedroom I flipped the light switch (expecting all but one of the bulbs to come back on, but they only came on for a fraction of a second then the lights in the house went out again. After again turning off the light switch and turning the fuse switch back on I tried again only this time nothing happened at all.

I assumed all the bulbs went (there are 4), I went out and bought some replacement bulbs after I had googled the ones I needed. (Apparently MR16 GU5.3, 20W)

After replacing all of the bulbs the same is still occuring, when I flip the light switch nothing happens.

Is it possible the wiring for my bedroom lights are messed up? Is it possible there's a fuse in the light fixture itself that has blown?

I'd rather not call out an electrician unless necessary. Last thing I want is to be told I just needed to replace a fuse.

105," I love my girlfriend, but she is not the girl I want to marry, and College A has offered me more money and more opportunities than College B, but College B has her full commitment. What do I do?","I'm 18, and a senior in high school. Aside from being a major point in my life in terms of figuring out what to do with the rest of my life, a problem is looming: how, or even if to bother at all, to fix the ailing relationship coming up on 2 years with my girlfriend. This isn't the first difficulty we have faced. As many long term couples know, you go through some shit. For the first 6 months of our relationship, it seemed like we were the **best** goddamn couple on the face of the planet. Around that time, we started experimenting with lightly sexual stuff (no actual sex.) 
She then did not have a period for a year.
We thought she was pregnant, and thought our lives were over.
We found out she wasn't, but not until we had been racked with stress and our first *real* fights. They came, and they went. For the next year, we kind of went on cruise control. We weren't the same people we had been before. I seriously fucked up and we came very close to breaking up. From that point on, we really haven't been remotely close to our former glory, but we fought on. 
It is now time for me to decide where to go to college, and I have two choices. College A has offered me more money thus far, and has more likelihood of letting me excel in the areas I'm likely to be interested in. 
College B has my girlfriend's full commitment right now.
I still love her, but I know that College A is the right place for me.

Three of my siblings end up went crazy, buy a brand new expensive vehicles or three, big expensive house in expensive area, invest heavily, try to start business, and all that. 

I end up quit my job, buy a small but decent house in a decent working class neighbor, pay off my car, paid off my debt, and upgrade few things (like new furniture because I was planning on doing it for a long time but never got around to it, wardrobe because most of my clothes are 3+ years old and showing it, and other things) But still keep it in a reasonable cost.

Beside that, I spend most money on traveling, all kind of tools (because I really enjoy making things and tinkering), old classic car to upgrade because it is what I enjoy doing, and scuba lesson which is something I've wanted to do for a long time. 

Yet some of my family are going nut telling me I'm wasting my money and I'm being stupid! They are trying to push me to try go back to my ex girlfriend (we mutually agreed to broke up some time ago because we were basically in long distance relationship) and have my vasectomy reversed so I can have children because ""I have money so I can afford to have a nanny!"" investing money, start business, etc... Hell they are even unhappy that I didn't buy the biggest and most expensive house I can find! 

I'm getting to the point where I just want to move out of the country and disappear because I'm just getting really fed up and sick with everyone thinking I need to do this and that then compare me with my sibling and all that!

My girlfriend and I have know each other for six months now, and since we've met we've been rather inseparable and while our relationship became official in late January we had been talking about such things before Christmas.

I've been in relationships before, including a serious 3 year one; my current girlfriend on the other hand hasn't been and so things between us move slowly. Yet she has managed to make me feel ways that no one else in my life has, we are similar enough that we get along but different enough that we push each others boundaries, and challenge ourselves to be our best. We spend a great deal of time together and three days without seeing each other is rather uncommon.

I know I love her, I have this dumbstricken happiness about her, and see a great future with her, and I want to tell her so badly that sometimes I feel it's going to come bursting out. The problem however is that she hasn't been here before, she's a no sex before marriage kind of girl, I'm her first boyfriend, (possibly her first kiss), and beyond kissing nothing else has transpired in the relationship (yup not even making out).

I fear that just based on who she is that ""I love you"" may be an astronomical deal for her something that she could over think to death.

Things have been going well in our relationship, I think it's safe to say we are moving forward, she is close she involves me with her friends and family, she even stayed over for the first time this past week as we are going away next month for the weekend and she was feeling uneasy about spending the night alone together so I suggested we have a sleep over where there weren't any expectations except for some damn awesome cuddling.

I'm head over heels for her and want to proclaim it to the world, I've tried to test the waters, but I'm really not sure what to look for, what to expect and if I should just dive in! She knows I'm falling for her, I just don't know if it's safe to use the most powerful words I know.

My dad had 3 kids before meeting and marrying my mom. They were all older than me and their mom had custody so we didn't grow up together. 

My parents (m62, f52)divorced when I was 11 and it was very ugly. Lots of hurtful things were said on all sides and I was too involved for an 11 year old. 

I stopped seeing my dad after my mom got full custody (my decision). Since then, he has turned all my family against me on his side. They all dropped contact and I haven't spoken to them in years. 

I have been trying to get information about my tomorrows scholar account (investment account you can only use towards education). My parents set it up together before their divorce, but my dad has all the information. I used it before and need it now to go back to school. They won't give me any info and tell me to contact my dad. I haven't yet and Don't plan to. 

Cut to today. At work I got 4 missed calls from a South Carolina (not where I live) number but didn't call back. They didn't leave a message. Then my brother (m26) that I haven't spoken to in literally 5 years or more messaged me on fb asking my middle name for ""a job application."" Not sure what job requires half sibling middle names. 

Small talk then he asks me my address?? 

I was too creeped out to respond but he told me he lives in sc now so I asked him did you try to call me today? No answer for a few hours now.

She also wants to go to the next school dance together (She already asked me but now it would be as friends). She also wants to plan a birthday party for me in a month.

After I discovered Reddit about four years ago I've become a lot more picky about what comment sections on web sites or forums I find to be any good. Most of the forums I used to lurk or post on before are just trash compared to Reddit now. To me I just see so many ignorant, immature or/and illiterate idiots on other sites compared to Reddit.

Don't get me wrong. Reddit has its fair share of trolls, stupidity and assholes too, but these people and submissions are usually often totally ignored, down voted or deleted/banned.

*To give you guys an example:* Earlier today I looked through the comment section on some of my local newspaper sites, I checked through the IMDB and Gamefaqs message boards. I also checked one of my favorite heavy metal news sites just for the heck of it too while I were at it.

What I saw was that most of the posts were just full of immature name calling, trolling, people with ignorant (or totally misleading) political or scientific meanings or just totally irrelevant posts which had absolutely nothing to do with the article/movie/music/game in the first place. It made me frustrated and angry just to read through some of the messages. I just wished the quality were better.

Is the quality better on Reddit in general or is it just I who have become a bit too picky, become more mature or/and ""elitist"" about other websites comment section? **Sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes (if there are any) by the way. English isn't my main language.

Apparently, he felt that we weren't as close as before although I didn't feel there was anything wrong. He is one messed-up, insecure individual.

Anyway, we sexted a few times. The first time, he confessed that he had sexual feelings for me. The truth was that I had been thinking of him in a sexual way too at the time, but I didn't say anything. So I responded to his sexts.

Later, he told me that he only confessed that he had sexual feelings for me because he was hoping that this would make me angry and stop talking to him. He basically wanted a reason for our friendship to break and used this confession hoping it would happen. He didn't expect me to instead show a sexual interest in him when I responded.

We were out of touch for a few months before we got back in touch. And a few days ago, he said that he wants to sleep with me and he can't stop fantasizing about me. The truth is that I'm sexually frustrated as hell (I'm a virgin), and this is the first opportunity that's come knocking at my door.

That said, he's not my type. I don't want to jump into bed with someone whom I don't respect anymore and I'm no longer friends with.

I have conflicting wants/needs right now. On the one hand, I need to get laid. Is a known devil really better than an unknown angel? Should I sleep with him just so I can relieve myself of my sexual frustration? Or should I take a step back and think of the consequences of my sleeping with him (if it should happen.)

We're going to be graduating in a year and we're starting to think about the future and whatnot!

He was always very against the idea of marriage. His parents split as a kid so maybe that's a factor.

A few years ago I didn't agree with him but now I'm in the same boat. We don't need anything forcing us to be together, we want to stay together out of choice. I've also never fantasized about a wedding or anything like that. I'd rather spend that money on travelling with him.

But we're still planning on getting a house together, pets and perhaps a kid someday. And I know these things can get really complicated if we ever split up. 

So I'm wondering what kind of benefits I lose from not getting married (in Canada) and how we should go about financial and family matters. I also have relatives that are already pressuring me for a wedding and I'm not sure how to address that. 

Some of my family really doesn't like that he's not Jewish. I have gotten a lot of rude comments from people like my Grandmother and Mother saying things like ""he's just a phase"" or that he's ""good practice until I find a rich Jewish husband"" and although it's being said jokingly it's hurtful that no one takes us seriously.  He also doesn't speak the language my family speaks at home so there' a bit a language/culture barrier but we're working on that so I'm hoping that won't be an issue eventually.

I had been in this relationship since right before college,  and I wasn't able to develop very close relationships with anybody since I've been at University.

I am looking for advice regarding reentry into a career (Accounting). I previously worked for a firm for 4 years and became a CPA. 

The problem with this firm was that it did not believe in staff training or career development and the job was dual discipline. Basically you learned the basics and that's about it. Which leaves me behind in my career (qualifications + years worked). I bailed last year when they (in a round about manor) asked me to sign a new contract for minimum wage.

I tried another accounting firm for a while (temp) and explained the dual discipline issue and asked for a low salary compared to 4 years + CPA. Yet the boss, despite paying a low wage and being told about my second discipline, had high expectations. He was also a downright asshole, even though I still broke budgets.

My question is that since my attempt at breaking out of accounting is about to fall apart, how do I approach the subject with my next employer. I don't want to jump back down and apply for uni grad jobs again, but I don't want to have too higher expectations placed on me by an employer. 

I want to tell the interviewer to keep the expectations in check as i will keep my wage down. Basically I want to let them know they haven't hit the jackpot of someone highly qualified working for peanuts but at the same time without putting myself down to the point of them going ""oh shit, this guy is garbage"" and me ending up jobless.

122," Gf struggles with depression, parents don't acknowledge it, and are very judgmental and rude about it.  What can I do to help her parents understand depression and how it can be a very serious thing (and not just ""a bunch of","I'll first start off by saying my gf is the type of person who is very reserved with her feelings.  She struggled with a bit of depression last year and just within the past month it has come back and hit her pretty hard.  Well after a couple weeks of noticing she was struggling but her not wanting to talk about it she finally decided to admit to me that she was struggling with depression and seeing a counselor.  Reasons for depression are not living up to expectations at college, at home (parents), and then struggling with being apart now that I have recently started grad school a few hours away.

Just yesterday she finally mustard up enough courage to tell her parents that she was struggling with depression and was so upset (bawling) that she had to stay the night at my apartment rather than drive home during the night.  Her parents are extremely old fashioned/religious and did not agree with her decision even though she specifically said she slept in a different room.  Her dad proceeded to tell her that her depression was ""a bunch of crap, to get it together, and not to mess it up for herself by continuing to do this or they would bring her home and stop paying for college"".  Her mom replied by saying ""if she can't figure out whats wrong with herself to quit her job and to quit school...if she can't handle it since (my gf) was the one that chose to go there"".  Not once did either parent even acknowledge the depression...

I spoke with her parents as briefly as possible saying I care about their daughter very much, I really want her to be happy, and I think it would help her tremendously if they gave her support. To which the mom replied ""this is my fourth daughter, I've dealt with plenty of drama, she knows how her parents roll and I don't need your advice"".

123, I have a very high libido and my girlfriend has never been interested in sex.  We are very close and very committed to each other but there is no passion in our relationship.  We are both very much in love and I don't want,"We've been together for about 3.5 years.  There have been some heavy ups and downs and a 5 month break up but we are still very close.

We are very intimate and have an unnatural connection with each other, never experienced this before in my life.  The problem is that there is no passion in our relationship.  We both find each other attractive but sex just does not work and it hasn't for something to the tune of 2-2.5 years.  

I have a very high libido and am a very sexual person.  I love exploring sex and my sexuality because I believe you become more in tune with yourself when you find your kinks.  My girlfriend has never been interested in sex.  I was her first partner when she was 18 and she's only been with one other person which was during our break (they fought about sex too even though it only lasted a few months).  I've had probably about 2 dozen partners and while to her that's kind of disgusting I don't really find it bad.  Some of them I probably shouldn't have slept with but through all those partners I've became very in tune with myself sexually.

I don't think we are going to meet on a sexual level, ever.  We've talked about it numerous times, tried new things but within a couple weeks it falls back to having sex maybe once every other week, sometimes once a month.  It kills my sexual attraction towards her, there have been times where I've said I'm not in the mood and waited until she went to sleep to masturbate because I have more fun doing that.  The same 10 minute routine and she's done is not working for me.

We are very committed to each other but I am having doubts about the long term because of the lack of passion in our relationship.  I don't want to be with someone for the rest of my life that I don't enjoy having sex with.

124, I have a new boyfriend who I really like and who I feel like I was falling in love with but seeing my old boyfriend who I was head over heels for and who never wanted to be with me again has messed with my emotions. What to do,"I am 23/F. Seeing my new boyfriend 24/M for a month and things are going very smoothly! I am very happy with him.

BEFORE him, I was seeing *unofficially* a 23/M  for nearly 8 months who I was head over heels for but he never wanted to be exclusive. I chose to move on after the 23/M pulled one of his stunts again, stated he wanted to get more serious after I threatened to cut him lose. A week later dumped me. The day he did I told him to fuck off I wasted too much time on him and didn't have any contact with him for a while.

Recently he messaged me, saying he was in a funk, hes back to his old self-- he thinks he loves me. He wants me to come back. Things will change. He has changed. It will be different this time. Etc. I have never heard him open up like that. 

This is what I wanted all a long. At one point I feel like I was falling in love with him. I waited 8 months for him. BUT... I am very happy with my current boyfriend and my current boyfriend has treated me like gold since day #1. I told 23/M this. I told him I also don't trust him since hes played games with me wanting to be with me then no then yes then no BS.

He's really fucking with my feelings. I have been stern with him and told him I don't want to leave my current SO but he knows how I feel about him. There will always be a place in my heart for him but he's almost at a point of begging AND part of me wants to be with him, or so I think? Im not sure if hes just manipulating me into thinking I still want to.

(Maybe he was","Being gay and pretty shy, I'm really not used to flirting, in fact most of my relationships started on dating websites. I just got hit on by a cashier (first time!), it should be cool but I made a seemingly awkward move and now I feel so ashamed, like a fucking teenager. I know I give this way too much seriousness, but I would be glad to hear other people's opinion.

Short story: after being given huge smiles, winks, and a free coffee by the cashier at McDonald's, I ask him for his number. It all goes well (even though I feel my heart beating in my throat), but I want to make sure he understands I'm into him. I decide to tip him (at McDonald's!), but having no small change, I awkwardly slip a 10€(14$) bill in his hand - when I ordered a 2€(3$) double cup of coffee. He has a shocked look on his face and thinks I must be kidding, so I lose control, ignore his objection, and leave as fast as I can.
Would you be freaked out if you were him ? (Maybe he was just looking for buddies as he came from Tahiti 6 month ago and don't know many people). Also I feel like a fucking idiot throwing my money like that when I'm a broke college student.

Her texts vary between being polite by asking me to help her with a problem she's having and then quickly switching to her being extremely hostile claiming that she hates me and doesn't love me(I don't know why her mood changed when we would just gradually talk). I asked her why she sends me such texts and if she feels that way, but she just says that her texts are due to a habit.

She's admitted to wanting to annoy me in the past and I like to think of myself to be quite a resilient person when dealing with such things, but tonight it started to get a bit more than I could handle. I simply requested her to not tell me about her private life if she was to continue attempting to contact me and after abusive texts intended to insult somebody she thought was using my phone she dropped it onto me.

A few hours ago I received a text from her stating that she was going on a date with another guy and claimed it was intended to be for her cousin when I questioned whether or not she was trying to get a rise out of me. The text hurt me a lot to read because despite me knowing it's better to be apart from her in the long term, it's never nice to hear such things about somebody who was once yours. All of the hostility she put towards me and now this nearly brought me to breaking point and I feel terrible, angry and sick at the thoughts of her being on a date with this person, which I accept is natural.

It's been really hard to contain myself from being nasty back towards her because I've had real anger issues in my past and have gradually dealt with them, but as hard as it was, I remained civil and said 'Okay, no problem'.

Does anybody understand what she's up to? Does she genuinely hate and resent me? Does she really want to inflict pain on me despite being civil towards her?

He is one of two managers and during the beginning of my job, he was off at corporate. When he came back, he almost instantly started flirting with me, dropping hints and such.

 After about a month, he really started slacking off in the relationship.

He always assigns me to the jobs no one wants to do, if I talk to any other male coworkers he will intervene, the whole ""get back to work"" thing, almost as if he is jealous.

 Recently, I found out he has been flirting with the other manager [19F], which surprised me because he had mentioned before they didn't like each other. She made it clear to us (the coworkers) she wasn't interested and was getting annoyed, because he was ""texting and snapchatting her every day and always came in when [she] was closing"".

131," Dad was emotionally abusive, stopped contact years ago, but still emails me begging for me to talk to him. Should I contact him again, or keep ignoring his emails?
TL;DR: Dad was emotionally abusive, stopped contact years ago, but","Hi guys, hoping for some advice, I'll try to keep it short.

So, from a young age I had a close relationship with my dad. I was definitely 'daddy's girl'. But as I got older and older, I began to see how emotionally abusive he was. He would tell me I was 'thick and stupid' a lot despite always getting the best grades in my class. Sometimes, he would give me praise and tell me that I was the smartest person he knew. But this was seldom said, and didn't feel like a real compliment given what the norm was.

So, as a late teenager, I stopped speaking to him. I stopped visiting, and broke off all contact. This was incredible painful for me to do, I did, and still do love him. But I couldn't cope with the name-calling anymore (he also used to scream and shout at me a lot which I got fed up of).

I tried to reconcile, and it was good for a couple of months. But then he turned again and I decided that I didn't want to go through it all again and cut off contact once more.

For a short while, he made threats towards me. But then stopped when he must have realised what an asshole he was being. (Perhaps may be worth mentioning he drinks a lot. he's what I'd consider a functioning alcoholic but I imagine these threats were made when he was *really* drunk).

So, it's been a number of years now since I last saw him (the last time I tried to reconcile). He emails me a lot begging for me to talk to him, and I feel really guilty and upset when I see these. I'm his only child, and he has no SO. I try to imagine what it would be like if I found out he was dead tomorrow, and sometimes I feel mortified that I never reached out. But other times I think 'well, he's sort of already dead to me'. So I don't know whether to contact him again, and try again, or to just leave it as I don't want the same vicious cycle to ensue.

Neither of us can afford the house on our own, so I need to find a new place.

The problem is, I've become extremely comfortable in recent years. Because I had my wife, I never made any really close friends - just a few guys I've worked with over the years who I tend to see once every few months. I'm the kind of guy who needs his own company, but I'm also at my happiest when I'm laughing and joking with a good group of friends.

So the idea of living on my own is kind of terrifying, if I'm honest. I can see myself getting into bad habits and spending weekends almost entirely by myself. I'm thinking finding a roommate is probably a good idea while I get back on my feet.

I live around 200 miles from my close family, so seeing them more than once a month will probably be too expensive. I will make more effort to see friends but in all likelihood I will be alone most weekends, especially since many of my friends are settled down.

At first the idea seemed crazy but the more I think about it the more I have grown to like it. I have been looking into grad schools in Paris and also internships.

My parents have always been extremely supportive of my decisions and I always look to them as a voice of reason when I need advice but this time they seemed to be completely bias so I want to make sure I am not making the wrong decision.

Then he promised to work on it. Since then we have had sex about 1 time (he didn't finish) now here's my problem, I understand his sex drive just isn't there anymore but he knows it's affecting me and won't seek help.

He's very well-educated and highly intelligent (much to his detriment). He's wonderfully attentive, loving, hilarious, intellectual. We do share many common values, have amazing sex, and are incredibly compatible emotionally. 

He's just completely unmotivated. He says he wants a career, but he thinks he's going to run into some CEO who's just going to give him his dream job. I don't care about income, just about him having a job I know he'd excel at.  

His parents are much older so I know that he's just sailing until they pass away (again, nothing sizable, but enough to live on simply without working).

His work ethic just goes against everything I believe it. I've worked my ass off since I was 14 to save for my goals. If I was fired/laid-off my first instinct would be to work up some amazing resumes and hit the pavement running. 

I don't know what more I can do to, I've helped him perfect his resumes, look for jobs, make connections. The longer he's unemployed, the more comfortable he'll become and the harder it'll be to get employed. What can I do to open his eyes??

But yesterday she said to me she has been putting on weight (which I expected) and it's stressing her out and making her unhappy.

We have our matric dance (prom to you Americans) in 2 months (she's my date obviously) and she wants to look as good as possible. Unfortunately, this means losing as much weight as possible. 

She's said to me she's going on a strict diet (which means not really eating much at all) and that she has made herself sick in the past in order to lose weight, which she said she probably will be doing closer to the dance. She hides it from her parents by running a bath while she does it. She said her parents have caught her doing it before and they got angry. 

I told her I don't care if she hates me, I will tell them. She told me if I do it will ruin us because **she won't be able to trust me or anyone again** and she has had trust issues in the past.

Now I really don't know what to do. I'm scared. I feel like a bad boyfriend.

She said she will be able to control it and that I mustn't worry but I obviously know life doesn't work like that; one minute you're in control, the next, you're not. And you don't even realize it.

I'd really like to get him some help, be it therapy or counselling. I'm guessing either me or him need to talk to our GP (we live in UK) about this issue, and see what he says, but I need to persuade my dad.

Despite all of these bad things, he is a good man at heart and am proud to be his son, please do not get the wrong impression about what I've said about him.

140, I took three cats into the shower with me and they all were fine with it. I was surprised at how well they all did. Pictures to come when I get my bf to take some (:,"I've taken three cats into the shower with me now. 

The first one I started when he was little, and he's fine with it now. (He has a terror of water usually, so it's a big thing for him not to care about going in the shower.) The second was one of my bf's parents cats and, though she made quite a bit of noise, she didn't freak out like I see so many cats in videos do when being placed in a body of water. Yesterday, I took another of my bf's parents cat in with me. He's quite a large cat and I wasn't sure that it was going to end well. Lo and behold - he was an angel. Within 10 minutes he was washed and being toweled down. No scratching, no freaking out at all. This is a 4 - almost 5 - year old cat who's never been bathed/showered before in his life. 

Unfortunately, I don't have any pictures at this time - I was more preoccupied with the cats than the taking of pictures TBH - but I'll wear a swimsuit next time and get my bf to take some pics. =)

141," I want to be a bartender after I graduate, is it a terrible idea and if so, how bad of an idea is it. Should I stick it out with what I'm doing or try to make a change in my life?","Hello Reddit, longtime user but first time for asking advice. 

I currently work as a journalist in Oklahoma and make around $27,000 a year, probably less. I've been there about a year now, there's talk of my department being put back on furlough (which only effects me technically) and there's been nothing but problems with out advertising department since I've been there. It's one of the more successful, though smaller, newspapers where I live and I got the job for work experience. I graduated with a degree in sports media and only have about $15k in student debts. With what I make now I just get by, can't save much but I'm not losing money.

Before I took this job I worked a a country club and as a server at a restaurant and made WAY more money doing that. A Buffalo Wild Wings is going to be opening where I live in a brand new shopping center and next to a casino. I went up there out of curiosity and wondering if they might need help for the weekend. I have about 7 years of restaurant experience and expected they wouldn't hire for just weekends.  Of course that was the case but the manager I talked to made it sound like he really like me and said that if my availability changed to definitely go back. I told him I wanted to be a bartender and we seemed in agreement on that. Maybe I'm living in another world but I honestly see more chance of advancement in a corporation like BWW then where I'm at now. Plus I've always enjoyed working in a restaurant and don't mind the fast-paced atmosphere.

I think I'd make more money if I was bartending full-time and I feel like I can always freelance with my writing skills. Plus I feel like transferring around at BWW wouldn't be that far-fetched of an idea if I did need to move. So basically Reddit, is it a terrible idea for me to go back to something like bartending after I've found a job doing what I went to school for? Should I stick it out with what I'm doing or milk what I think will be a cash cow and work on my career in the process?

142," I checked my bag on an international flight and it was lost. I feel like I should have kept my shaver with me, but I was too lazy to do so and now I feel like a loser. ","So this happened a few hours ago. I had to catch a flight from Surat (Gujarat, India) to Delhi early this morning. I was busy attending weddings and shopping (as is the norm for visiting folks) and I'm also a bit of a procrastinator. 

So I started and finished packing my bag for the flight just a few minutes after midnight today. It was mainly clothes and other hair / body care products. Now a few days back, I had to attend a cousin's engagement function and we were all going to meet at a house and get ready and leave. So I packed all the necessary belongings and I was off. One item was my Braun Series 7 shaver. 

So fast forward to bag packing. I debated whether to bring it or not, and whether to put it in my hand baggage (backpack) or suitcase. Ended up putting it in the suitcase probably because it was late at night and having just got back from an Indian wedding, my mind was fried like a French fry, crispy on the outside but soft as shit on the inside. 

You could probably see where this is going -- checked bag in, boarded the flight, and they lost the bag. 

Of course I'm disappointed that I lost my clothes as well, but there's this horrible feeling inside me that I should have kept the shaver with me, especially since I had kept it in my backpack on my original US to India flight a few weeks ago.

The main issue is that I am in a serious relationship [M 20]. We;ve been dating for almost a year, and live together. We also have fur babies and a temporary roommate. Don't know if that's useful information, but it's a bit of background.

So for some reason I cannot get aroused. It's not that I'm not attracted to my boyfriend; I love him to death and could not imagine life without him. But no matter what he or I do, it doesn't work. I used to have a *very* active sex life. Before I met him I had muliple partners, and after we got together he was my only one, but we were having sex 3-5 times a day. Now it's maybe once every 2 weeks, and that's with generous lube because I'm as dry as the Sahara. I want to be close and intimiate with him, btu my body won't cooperate.

And it's not him. He tries massages, romance, kinky stuff, etc., but nothing works. I don't even have the urge to masturbate anymore, because nothing arouses me. I've run out of ideas to try, and don't want to ruin our relationship because of it. He hasn't said that it's bothered him, and he wants to be my one and only, but I know it's not fair to him.

At a new years party this year (the one just gone) we kind of ""got together"" we didn't sleep together but we both know we could have we both just agreed we were too drunk and stuff, i also told her that i liked her and she said she liked me back, so after that i message her as normal and i asked her out, but it turns out she is ""kinda"" seeing someone else at her university, so we had a big conversation about it and decided to just be friends, due to that we started talking less and less.
Turns out this dude completely screwed her over and dumped her in a massively uncool way and because we didnt talk as much she never told me and i feel really guilty that i didnt help her feel better after that.
my friend had a bbq last Saturday and she was there too, and we kinda got together again and we were sitting together for hours and she told me that she has always had a soft spot for me and that she has liked me ever since she met me, the thing is that she is moving away to Canada in less than a month, she asked me if she could see me again before she leaves and i really want to see her but I'm really confused on what to do shes someone very very special to me and i don't want to end our relationship but i still really like her and i wish she wasn't going.

She's been doing especially badly the past few days because it'll be her first Christmas without her dad, who died a few months ago. Panic attack, sobbing, and the whole works of grief.

I recognised his number plate because it ended in NWA (I know- I would be ecstatic) 

We met later in heavy traffic, here's where I plotted my revenge- I pulled up on his left (I'm in England so we drive on the left side of the road- I'm on his passenger side) and I saw that my lane was going to move before his- just before I moved off, I gestured to him to wind down his window (manually as it was an old car) acting like I was saying something about his car.. Once he got the window down, i drove off with the traffic.

I know first hand how annoying it is to stretch across to do that and I would have been livid if it was the other way round.

Is there something I can do to make her feel better and maybe get her to want me again?,"We have been dating for 2 years. Everything was perfect, much love and everything was how it was supposed to be. After about 4 months into the relationship we started living together in the city where we are both students. As I said everything was going great. We were both very happy and we would die for one another. Until about 4 months ago. I was a bit jealous of her interactions with males she knew althouh I knew she was 100% loyal. We had a fight and the it was the first time she said she wasn't feeling happy and wanted to split. After some talking we agreed to wait and see if it can work again. And so it did(I think). But about 3 months ago I screwed up again by being too bossy with her and one day she got angry about it and again said she still doesn't feel the vibe of being inlove and said she didn't love me. We continued livimg together and after a week or so we agreed to try and make it work because we really care for eachother and want it. I changed my attitude towards her much and I was the same person she fell inlove 2 years ago. Now we work at the same building and we ocasionally work together. Today we talked about those things and she said she feels very very confused about what she wants and if she wants me or want to give up. Also she said she still doesn't feel the same way half an year ago. I told her Iwill give her all the space and time she needs to clear her head and decide what she wants to do next and maybe understand her feelengs.

I walked past a lingerie store and suddenly remembered hearing that something like 80% of women wear an incorrect bra size. On a whim and out of curiosity (and a desire to procrastinate walking back to work), I decided to go in. The sales associate offered to help with measurements and fitting. I couldn't help but notice that she had a severely deformed right arm, which ended at the elbow and had no hand. I made a conscious effort to make strong eye contact with her and not to look at it. Despite the missing hand, she was adept at using the tape measure by wrapping it a few times around the elbow stump, positioning it with her good hand, and doing the necessary math. (For example, instead of starting at zero, the tape measure would now ""begin"" at 40-something. Simple enough) Everything went very well at first. She brought me a few pretty bras to try on. I fumbled for a few minutes with a small and stubborn clasp, and asked if she could come in to the change room for a second.

I am 20f, my boyfriend is 24m. We've been together officially for almost a year and seeing each other for a year and a half. I have loved him from the very beginning. I wasn't always head over heels but I was always really fond of him from the second I saw him. I left for school after the summer and we couldn't stand being apart so we've been living together for the past year or so.

Yesterday I woke up feeling a little different about him. It was like I fell out of love with him overnight. I was scared and confused and I kept analyzing and telling myself I still loved him but I guess I didn't really believe it myself. This morning I woke up and felt it again... I couldn't stop smiling when I saw him... it was love all over again... but this evening I'm questioning it once again. I'm terrified of breaking up with him, not because I'm scared of him or anything like that, but because I was so sure he was my perfect guy. He's my superman and the love of my life, and I don't know what to do.

The only thing I can think of that could be happening is that I'm becoming depressed again. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder very young and about two months ago I started becoming lax with my meds. I probably have taken them 2-3 times in the past three weeks. I thought I was fine but maybe it's starting to numb my emotions. The last thing I want is to fall out of love with him and lose the first wonderful relationship that I've felt truly secure in.

We're sexually exclusive but label-less and we just introduce each other to people by our names.

We cook together, we sleep in a tangled pile, we have fun in group settings, we wine and dine, we have cosy weekends in. I feel like I can be pretty open with him and I'm happy with the way things are. It just feels kind of silly correcting my friends when they refer to him as my boyfriend (not in front of him obviously). I've never really been the one to initiate the DTR talk though, so I don't know how to go about it without making it awkward. Halp, reddit?

161," I love my girlfriend, but she's been a bit of an emotional wreck lately, and I don't want to deal with it anymore. She's a great girl, but I don't want to be unhappy in the relationship. What do?","Original Topic here: 

Since then I've talked to her about some things I don't like, and nothing has changed. If anything my girlfriend has started randomly talking about how terrible her dad was more. And I don't mean new stories, I mean stories i've heard at least 5 times now, randomly while we're driving to dinner. It's really getting to me. I think she has family issues and really needs help.

I love her, and there were a few days where she was normal and relaxed. But those few awesome days just don't seem worth dealing with an emotional wreck. I've been waiting for it to get better for around a half a year, and her parents divorce court date is set for december. I definitely do not want to be unhappy until then. 

But I do still really like her, and I don't want to make the situation worse for her. The last thing I want to do is hurt her. I'm just not happy in the relationship. 

I'm currently taking some studying for some finals coming up and I feel like just telling her I need to study for them, and putting the relationship on the backburner. I just know she'll handle it terribly. 

I just would like some advice, i'm kinda hanging on by a thread right now.

163, I need my transcript from a school in NYC that is affiliated with a college in NY who issues college credits per course.  I have tried contacting the school directly and the school has no record of my transcript request.  What can I do to get,"I would appreciate any input as I'm at my wit's end with trying to get a copy of my transcript and I'm wondering what my legal rights are.  My apologies if this is long, I'm trying to be complete.  I am in the US.

*The Details:*
I am currently enrolled as an online undergraduate at a university in Utah.  Around the same time I started taking classes casually at that school before I was admitted, I took classes in American Sign Language at an Institute in NYC (where I reside).  The institute was affiliated with a state college in NY who grants college credits per course. 

Fast-forward to now: I applied for formal admission to my online university and need all of my transcripts.  I submitted the transcript request to the institute per their instructions in January, which said to allow 6-8 weeks for processing.  At 10 weeks, I followed up with an email and received no response.  I followed up again at 12 weeks, no response.  At 13 weeks, I called twice (their ""office hours"" are limited to only a couple hours per week) and left voicemails.  I finally received an email response to my original email apologizing, saying it would go out at the end of that week.  I followed up at the end of the following week and the week after when neither myself nor my school had received it.  I received no response.  At this point, I tried to contact the director of the school (it's a small institute and she is the only person ""above"" the instructor who processes the transcripts).  I have received no response to emails or voicemails.  

It has now been 17 weeks and I still have no transcript. I have tried contacting the credit-issuing college directly, but it seems they don't issue the credit until the institute gets a transcript request and provides the college directly with their academic records for the requesting student.  I'm at a loss because I need to transfer these credits in, and even more so, I'm worried that this will be a problem next year for my grad school applications as I could miss deadlines while they're waiting for all of my transcripts.

TL;DR: I broke my kitchen appliances,","This just happened about half an hour ago.

I left my apartment in the early afternoon on sunday for a weekly meet up with my friends in an adjacent city. When I returned home, I went straight to bed, exhausted at midnight. 

The following afternoon, I woke up (yes I slept until 1) and went about as normal. At about 3 i started to get hungry, so I went and checked my fridge. At first I was just puzzled, because the light bulb didn't come on. I pushed the switch several times, but nothing happened. Then I noticed there was no sound. And then I noticed that everything in the fridge was barely cold. I opened the freezer, and most of my meat had thawed, but was still pretty cold. So I started checking all the other appliances, and my entire kitchen would not turn on. Breaker switches were all fine, so I was stumped.I freaked out and called my landlord, who called an electrician. The electrician would not be able to come out for 2 full days!

This is where I made fuck up #1. Instead of immediately going to the store and getting an extension cord to plug the fridge into a different outlet, I waited until about an hour ago. I ran to the store, and ran back home, hoping i could save some of my freezer food.

This is where the big FU happens. I unplug my fridge, and unplug the surge protector that had my microwave and toaster oven. The fridge cord won't reach the surge protector, and the stuff plugged in to the surge protector prevent me from reaching the fridge. I go to plug the thing back in, and notice a red button that says ""RESET"". I pushed the button. And everything turned back on. I am an idiot, and now I have no food.

Anyways, I recently quit waiting tables, but when I did there was this older guy that would come in who is a hockey expert. On the side I blog for a sports website as a hockey analyst and loved when this guy would come in during games and give me his two cents. He always gave me tips and great stuff to write about, and I really value his opinion. Now that I am not a server, I have made plans to watch the games this weekend with this guy at a bar. He is very aware that I have a boyfriend and would never try anything with me. However, even if I explained this to BF he would be pissed and all crabby about me going. He's pretty irrational about it, and I've had a million conversations with him but he won't budge. So, if I tell him, he's going to be mad and I'm going to go anyways and it's going to be a fight. If I don't, I'm lying to him about what I'm doing, but saving a fight and a lot of drama. Help! I have never hidden something like this from him before but I just don't feel like I have the energy to argue with him this week.

166," I broke up with my girlfriend because of her college history of sleeping with multiple guys in one day.  Should I apologize and try to get her back, or is it better to move on and find someone better?","I've been dating my girlfriend for two years, she's great. Our only issue, which has come multiple times via fights throughout our relationship, is that she slept around a lot in college.  This issue is magnified as she went to college with many members of our friend group, a college that I didn't attend.

Going into the relationship, I've heard stories from my friends about her (two guys in one day, getting back at guys by sleeping with their friends) but we clicked really well.  And college was over, figured there was a chance that she changed.  However, the thought of her past was always in the back of my head.

Because of this information, I've been very quick to jump the gun when she flirts with any guys, whether a co-worker or out at a bar.  Our bickering about her flirtatious attitude really escalated this past friday night when I saw her drunkenly texting a guy she used to hook up with in college.  A guy who recently moved back to our small town and was on the fringe of our friend group.

I saw the texts and they seemed too flirty for my liking.  I just didn't want the fear in the back of my head of this being anything.  I snapped and broke up with her the next day.

She was devastated.  Crying.  Explaining how she was a great girlfriend, had never cheated on me, and had never come close.  She explained the full context of the flirty texts and if her story was true (it does match up), then maybe I truly overlooked it.  I tried to apologize, but the damage was done, we were over.

Now, we're broken up.  I'm miserable.  I loved her, she was the best.  And she's going to a beach house with this guy from the texts and another part of our group of friends next weekend.  What do you guys think? Should I try to apologize and get back with her, and if so, what would I say?  Or is it better to get out now, other fish in the sea.

167, Boyfriend refuses to spend the night at my place. I took his apple pie with me and now he wants it back. How can I make him see that his refusal to spend the night at my place hurts me?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 10 months. He is charming and introspective and I just want to make him happy. To make him feel loved and cherished and wanted.

Which brings us to the apple pie.

He loves baked goods and I love him so today I was making him an apple pie. Handmade. Family recipe. Catered to his dietary needs. 
While I was making him the pie he mentioned not coming over to my place tonight after his club because he'd have to go back to his place to shower. I mentioned he could take a shower at my place. No. 

This wouldn't be a big deal but for a few things.
1) He has never spent the night at my place. I am the one who always goes over to his place.

2) Yesterday we were watching the debates and he said he wanted to do an experiment. What if we only spent two nights a week with each other. (Currently we spend 4-5 nights together). I said yes conditional that one night a week he spends the night at my place. He agreed.

3)We agreed that he would spend tonight at my place. 

4) I have been trying and begging for months for him to spend the night at my place. 

Admittedly I was not paying attention to the rest of what he said after that but I assured him all was fine. Fine. 

All was not fine. I finished making the pie and I feel small and dismissed and that he would just keep pushing back spending the night at my place. That he doesn't respect me. 

So I took the apple pie with me and went to my place. 

He called and asked where his pie was. I told him my pie was with me at my place. 
He said I was being disrespectful and playing games and to keep the pie.

I don't want the damn pie, I want my boyfriend to spend the night at my place. How can I make him see that his refusal to spend the night at my place hurts me?

168, I filled out my FAFSA incorrectly and now have a bill for 3k dollars that I can't pay and may lose any chance of a better future for me. Is there anything I can do to get the university to pay it off or at,"([UNM] Albuquerque, New Mexico) 
  
To start off with some background, during my senior year of high school I was very pessimistic towards the hype surrounding college preperation and the importance of the FAFSA was never clearly illustrated to me. I honestly thought the only thing it did was determine how large your pell grant is. I filled out my FAFSA in febuary and I thought I would be staying home for my first year, turns out during the summer my close friend and I decided to live on campus as roomates. Now here is where the problem originates. 

What I did not know was that the FAFSA does not only determine your pell grant, but it also is used to determine your cost of attendance by your university. This estimate is actually a limit for the amount of aid a student is allowed to recive and one's estimate will differ significantly if they are listed as living at home vs on campus. 

During the summer I applied for a loan to cover the cost of my spring semester. The process takes a while but we finally got approved and they were ready to send the funds to the school, but they would not allow them to be applied towards the last semester. After many calls we finally got the University to apply them towards the spring, but wouldn't let the full amout be paid. They told us that they could only allow the amount of aid they had determined to be dispersed, even though we secured a loan for the full amount. It made no sense to me why their estimate would be incorrect so I went digging through my info and found that I was listed as living at home so I quickly contacted them in person to explain and was basically told it was too late and they couldn't do anything.

So now I am left with a bill for 3,000 dollars and I can register without paying it off (parents are not well off and can't help) and if I dont register by next semester I will have to start paying off the loans they did let me use. Is there anything I can do? I know I made a mistake but this could ruin any chance of a better future for me. Thanks for taking the time to read.

172, I broke the lease on a house I moved into with a roommate who lied to me about a job that was going to pay rent and utilities. Can I get out of paying the rent and utilities that were due to the landlord because of the lease breaking,"I'll try to make this short.

Two years ago I was offered a job in Louisiana by a friend. The job was working with my friend digitizing records in radio stations making a good amount of cash, and the company hiring us to do this work would also pay our rent. Sounds too good to be true right?

So we end up moving down there into this big rental house, which I was ok with because the company is going to be paying the rent. Only thing is, the job has been postponed for a couple months so we both needed to get jobs to pay the bills until the job started.

So, 3 months later, my roommate has started acting pretty strange. Very secretive, moody, seems angry a lot, goes out a lot. I think they're doing drugs. I ask about the job, have they heard anything about it, and I get stony glares and ""stop bothering me about it already, it'll be soon."" Always soon. The job is starting soon.

So I decide to look at the situation I'm in. I can't afford the rental because it's way too expensive for what I make. I can't stand the roommate anymore because it seems as if I'm being lied to about this fantasy job and the person I moved in with is not the person I'm dealing with now.

So I leave. I break the lease and just take off. The landlord got in touch with me and said I'd be responsible for that month's rent and the next months. I didn't pay because I figured it would just go away, or that the ex-roommate would pay it knowing they'd done me wrong.

So here we are, two years later, and I get a summons in the mail. I'm being sued by the ex-roommate for almost 3 grand for breaking the lease, 2 months rent, utilities, and moving expenses for them.

My question is, do I have a case? I would have never signed the contract had I known the job was a lie. What case do they have against me? Do judges make exceptions like this in court?

What","My GF and I met almost 4 years ago now, started dating 3 and a half years ago, and had a great relationship. 

Long story short, I regrettably made the (I think smart, rational) decision to break things off because I'm not sure I want to ever get married or have kids, whereas she does. I feel like being with her while not being 100% committed to those things with her is unfair to her. 

The problem is, now that we've been apart for some time, I'm realizing the relationship we shared was incredibly special and far more intimate than anything I've ever experienced. I'm at the point where I feel like nothing will ever surpass the intimacy and good feeling of this relationship. 

I dated a lot in HS, and even my first year of college before meeting my GF, and I am fairly confident in my ability to assess the success and failures of my relationships past. IMO, the only thing that caused our breakup was basically myself being nervous about what the future holds vis-à-vis kids, marriage, etc. 

She's talked a little bit about wanting to wait for me until I figure out what I want; and I do want to do that. But with every moment I spend away from her, I realize that not having her in my life is far scarier than having kids or getting married. 

I guess my question is do I try to get back with her now and not worry about the future, figuring all those things out in stride, risking breaking up with her again, or fully figure it out (which may take years) and potentially lose the love of my life?!

Is asking him to stop calling me names even though it's a joke too much for me to ask? Or am I over reacting over this? Am I just being too sensitive and taking his jokes ""too seriously""?

Sorry for that little rant, I just feel frustrated and dumbfounded by this whole situation. I'd really appreciate to hear your thoughts/inputs on this. Thanks!

179," I want to find activities for my 19 month old that are fun and educational, and that don't involve toys.  She's very active and curious, but not very coordinated yet, and is very into learning.  What are some things we can","So winter... is coming.  

We spend an hour or two outside of the house each day just wearing her out, and I'm finding I'm at a loss for activities to fill our day when we can't.  I've been looking for ways to involve her in my chores and whatnot, but I'm really lacking creativity here. 

Kid has a snowsuit for winter of course, but it gets very cold and windy here, such that there will be many weeks worth of cold snaps to fill without playing in the snow together.

Capability wise, she's very mobile and relatively coordinated with her hands.  She still has trouble following directions that involve delicate physical skills (has trouble dumping a bowl of ingredients in for me as an example), but I can't say how fast that will come.  We spend a lot of time reading books and learning words, but I feel like I should be doing more ""fun"" things with her that don't involve her toys. 

What kind of crafts are appropriate for toddlers?  What about 'educational' activities, or motor skill practice can I do with her?

A little about her: she's 19 months, very interested in potty training atm- pushing it more than even I expected to myself, loves to dance and sing and colour and watches too much tv while she's playing... she's learned to turn it on herself when I'm out of the living room, god help me, although I do try to play music as an alternative.  All in all she's a bright girl, but sensitive to harsh stimuli and generally eager to please, but getting into some heavy tantruming lately.

I'm tired of reading nursery rhymes and dr.seuss and pointing out words for the pictures we see in her books.  It's getting dull!

It's sad, no one was at fault and we all still thought highly of each other. She said she hoped we could still be friends. It was all very mature and respectful.

We had a period of nice, friendly but limited contact which ended with me saying I couldn't be friends with her without a reasonable explanation of why we broke up (her reason at time was she just suddenly wasn't feeling it anymore). So we had a little post-mortum via email (which was stressful but again very respectful and thoughtful on both sides) and I felt a lot better, got closure and said we were cool and hoped we could be friends. 

Since then, we're not even friendly anymore. She awkwardly avoids me when she sees me and the few times I've reached out with a non-chalant text or email, she gives a short blunt reply or none at all.

We had been so mature and up front about the whole thing up to this point it upsets me that its come to this. I'm not expecting us to get back together or be bffs but flat out ignoring me?

I am very grateful that my parents are letting me live with them again as I finish college, and try to be as unobtrusive as possible, helping occasionally to make dinners and staying out of the way. My Mom treats me like dirt. Every time I talk to her or try to be nice and hang out with her, she shuts me down pretty rudely. She's pretty embittered towards me I guess, because even though I feel like I am making the efforts to try and have a happy relationship, I get the feeling she is not interested. It's kind of crappy to be rejected by your own mother in quasi-adulthood. 

What makes it harder to understand is my younger brother also lives in the house, and while he treats my mom very badly (super spoiled, demanding, rude, demeaning) they have a seemingly solid relationship. Its very obvious that she cares about him and makes a lot of effort to be a part of his life and make him feel loved and cared for. 

My birthday is coming up next week, and today my Mom refused to plan some kind of celebration.

Well, I pulled on the cord a little too hard and the vibrator stopped working. Fuck fuck fuck! I take it apart and find that the wires from the cord were pulled out of the spot where they connected to the vibrating mechanism. I clean the fuck out of it, and put it back where it was. Then I decide to go to the place we bought it and buy the same one. They only had it in pink. Fuck! So with my last option, I go to home depot and buy a solder gun (I have never used, held, or have seen anyone use one before). Go home, look up a YouTube video on how to solder. After 4 miserable fails and the house smelling like this solder crap, I finally get it to work!!! Fuck yes!!!!!! I am very careful when putting it back because a couple times the wires came back off. It will probably break the next time we use it and I will be clueless. I will either offer to solder it or buy a new one.

No actual sexting/phone sex, but we danced around the line a lot. I'm returning to work on Tuesday and it will be the first time we've seen each other since this started. 

He's a big game-player - being vague and hard to get. I'm really not a game-player so I'm waaaay out of my league here, but I think I got him interested because I wasn't actually interested in him at first and was less responsive to his ""advances,"" and thus was inadvertently playing hard to get. 

I thought I wanted just casual sex, but as things progressed, it seems I might want a little more than that. But I'm not sure what he's thinking - he's super flirty and our talks are generally sex-related but he's also said things that indicate that he may actually care about me, too. 

He went out drinking last night with friends and now I'm a little freaked out about the fact that he slept/flirted/was otherwise intimate with someone else. He intimated that he might hook up - but I couldn't tell if he was just doing his game-playing thing or if he's just actually not interested or is just interested in sleeping with whoever (he's not currently sleeping with anyone)...he seems to be investing a lot of time in someone in whom he's not really interested, though.

My best friend and I had been through a lot of ups and downs with our friendships throughout the years. We are just normal friends and nothing romantic going on. We were good friends throughout high school and college. 

During college it was more difficult to hang out because of distance with her living an hour away from me. So our friendship had slowly drifted apart in the last few years. We tried to hang out as much as possible, but our schedules conflicted a lot with work/school.

**Situation:**

Basically, I asked my best friend to go on a trip to Chicago, she declined because she told me she had work. I invited other friends, but that didn't work out either so my plan failed. 

A different group of friends asked me to go on a last minute plan on a hiking trip to another state on the day I was planning to go to Chicago. So I went, posted pictures and best friend got mad at me for not inviting her. After I explained that it wasn't my plan, it was last minute and the fact that she had work is why I didn't invite her. To me I think it was blown out of proportions to end our friendship over that. The past 3.5 months I have not communicated with her and tonight she sent me a text about continuing our friendship or not. 

I am not even exactly sure now. We have a lot of history and she introduced me to several friends that I am friends with now. But on the other hand I just feel like something like this is bound to happen again. I am a bit tired of this friendship going up and down.

I recently helped my brother rescue a stray kitten with conjunctivitis and it looks like the little guy's going to lose his eyes. Luckily, no surgery, just lots of compresses and intensive medication until he's healed up. He's also quite young, about 2 months now. It's been expensive (meds changing constantly because he's growing), but worth it to watch him get better.

It's been 4 weeks since his first vet visit and he's starting to act like a typical kitten. He runs in circles a lot, and he still runs into objects. The worst is when he tries to play with the other cats (his mom and siblings were welcomed into the house when my brother adopted him). He backs up, gets on his haunches and is very obviously about to pounce, but then he chickens out because he has no idea where he's going. Once he jumped too high and pounced into the wall above his sister. He wants to play rough, but has no idea how. I'm glad he's trying, though. 

We're 99% sure he's already blind, as the existing eye tissue is nearly gone and his eyelids are closing up on their own. We try to keep him in one room so that he can get to know that area through his other senses, and we supervise him when he's in unfamiliar rooms. Not sure what else we can do to help. There are adult cats in the house besides his mother, but they don't seem to mind him.

I sit down, joke a bit, and continue running my game.

So that's what I'm trying to figure out: how to ask this girl on a date.  I don't want to be to subtle; I don't want her to think I just want to hang out and be friends.  But I also would prefer not to create a situation which will be incredibly uncomfortable if she doesn't want to.

For the record, I think there's a fairly good chance she'll want to.  She remembered my name even back a year ago (although maybe she's just good at that.)  And whenever we run into each other she seems very happy.  She also seems to take every chance to talk to me she can.  She is a very positive person though, so it could just be that.  Of course, again I have no experience in this matter so...

Thanks for any advice you can give me, and if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them.

200," I was pulled over and searched after the officer claimed his dog alerted to my trunk. I have a lawyer who says there is a chance of getting my money back and even suing the police department, but I wanted to ask others to see if there is","I was driving across the country to a convention (AZ) with a large amount of cash ($50,000) with the intention to stock up on merchandise there for my business back on the east coast (FL). En route, I was pulled over for looking at my GPS system and illegally searched after the officer claimed his ""dog's behaviour changed"" as he led it around my car. The cash wasn't anywhere near where the dog allegedly alerted (trunk vs midsection). As soon as the cop saw it, he put me in the cruiser and confiscated the cash. They eventually let me go without any charge, but they still have my money. I received a notice stating I have 30 to file a claim on the seized assets. During the search, the officer found a few pain pills and some cannabis floating around the car, but I wasn't charged for those.
 
I contacted a lawyer who offered either $2500 + 33% or a flat $7500 fee. I essentially have no money after this and would need to get a loan to pay either way. My question is is there any chance of getting the money back from the police? It's a small town so I'm afraid they'll fight tooth and nail for the money rather than letting it get away.
 
The specifics of the case that stand out to me are as follows: the officer relied on the canine for his justification to search, but there was no visual cue from the dog. It just jumped up onto the car wherever he pointed and sniffed around (not to mention scratched my paint). The officer brought attention to my being an Arab, asking me if my friends called me ""terrorist.""  He was wearing a video camera so if the footage canned into play, it could corroborate my account. After they finished questioning me at the station, they left me high and dry in the middle of nowhere with no money (and even froze two bank card accounts). The lawyer I consulted recognized the name of the officer because he has a reputation of turning every stop into a search. I want to hope that I could get my money back and even sue them for their history of illegal searches, but wanted to ask others to see if it seems like I have a chance on the first place.

201, I don't want to start a relationship with a woman I love because I don't want to deal with the inevitable end of the relationship when she leaves the country. Is there a way to feel better about the situation or is there a better way to,"I work abroad for the local government and have been dating this girl for the last two months. We met six months ago, but only really got to know one another rather recently. 

There's no guarantee that we'll end up in the same place after her contract runs up and there's no telling what mental place we'll both be in a year and a half from now when she eventually returns to the states.

That being said, I've been getting a ton of pressure from her and our mutual friends to start a relationship with her, despite knowing it will end when I leave the country. I'm against relationships with a timer on them and I've had really bad experiences with long distance relationships. It's entirely a personal thing, I simply cannot handle them.

Our mutual friends seem to think that if I love her, I'll just suck it up and go into a relationship. She wants the title because we're in a relationship in everything but the name. I'm just trying to enjoy the time I have left with her without thinking about any of this. 

The cause for me to doubt my stance is that I absolutely love this woman. I've never clicked so quickly or easily with anyone before in my life. We love the same things, our personalities mesh, we can spend a ridiculous amount of time in one another's company without encroaching on each other's space simply because we both require the same kind of ""alone time"". Basically, we both feel like we can engage in our normal decompressing hobbies while in one another's company and still have it feel like we're doing it completely alone.

I can play games, read, draw, browse Reddit, or what have you, and still feel like I'm recharging my introverted batteries and she feels the exact same way with me. This is huge to both of us.

We both agree we fit in wonderful ways we never thought was possible and the only thing we're divided on is the title. She wants to be in a relationship, even if it'll end in six months. Whereas I don't feel comfortable starting something we both know will end relatively soon. 

Am I just feeling afraid of something I shouldn't fear?

202," Boyfriend is going to NY for a party, and I'm uncomfortable with it. He knows, but hasn't said for sure whether he's going or not. What should I tell him, and is it unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable with his","My boyfriend (Jack) is in a fraternity, and some of his fraternity brothers are planning to go on a 12 hour road trip to NY in order to visit a fraternity chapter's party there. Jack says that the parties they throw are huge-- up to hundreds of people. The thing is, I'm very uncomfortable with that. 

I'm not going to lie and say that it isn't partly because it's a Halloween party, where there will be tons of girls dressed extra promiscuously. That is, honestly, a factor in this. The fraternity is also an asian fraternity, so there will be loads of asian girls there. He told me before we were dating that he has a ""thing"" for asian girls. This makes me even more uncomfortable (and, I'll admit, insecure) about him going. Yes, I know that this is not a good reason to ask him not to go. I'm being insecure, and I need to trust him.

However, I am also a huge worrier. I get anxiety, and I overthink things all the time. I know that if he goes, I'll worry about/through the whole 12 hour drive up there, and the 12 hour drive back down. I'll also worry that he's going to get drunk or high and do stupid things at the party(he is notorious for doing dumb things when he's drunk). This bigger the partier, the crazier they are. And people seem to go to those parties to just get wasted and laid. These are the main reasons for why I'm uncomfortable with him going. There may be other reasons that I just can't pin down.

He knows that I'm uncomfortable with him going, so he hasn't said for sure whether he's going or not. He says that he really wants to. When he asked why I don't want him to go, I said I'd tell him later, when I'm done studying for my tests.

Basically, I want to know if you think that I'm being unreasonable by being uncomfortable with him going. And I want to ask for any advice on what to tell him tomorrow.

My wife and I have been together for 8 years, and within that time I would say we've had a pretty great relationship.  However, we're now at a point where my libido is significantly higher than hers (it's always been higher), not only that, but my emotional well-being is, and always has been, closely tied to sex.  So any libido difference is really exaggerated to me.

To make a really long story less long, here's a synopsis: She tells me it seems like I want sex all of the time and frequently denies my advances.  I ask for sex probably once every other day (mostly denied).  She initiates sex maybe once every other week, and I never deny her.  Every week we end up having sex about once or twice (on a really good week).   

The point being, no matter the frequency, she is basically in control of our sex life, and I'm left feeling powerless and depressed.  While she doesn't take advantage of that specifically, I find myself doing anything I can to please her in the hope that I'll be able to have sex with her (to no avail)... and I'm pretty sure that's super unhealthy.  

I'm looking for advice. I'm really not sure where to go from here.  I'm definitely not willing to leave her, and she seems incapable of understanding how I feel about this topic, so I'm afraid nothing is ever going to change.

What I realized only once I had already picked and examined the puss from my forehead, was that it had been my groups turn to act out our project,  and I had been in my seat blankly staring at the wall while my group was up front; the whole class was looking at me. I watched the majority of my classmates' faces turn from confusion to disgust, as it dawned on me that they had been watching me pop my huge pimple for the past 10 seconds. And yes, the cute girl saw it also. Fuck.

We have an 19 pound turkey, and I've been looking forward to spending the day just cooking and stuff. On Thanksgiving, I tried the Alton Brown turkey recipe (brined, roasted without stuffing) and it was great. With all the hubub from American Thanksgiving about spatchcocking a turkey, I thought that'd be great to try out! I'm confident in my ability to cut out the backbone and roast it, but I had mentioned to my buddy how good it was to lay some bacon over the breasts while the last one roasted and he bought 3 pounds for this dinner. So in a really rambling way, I guess I'm asking if covering the spatchcocked turkey in bacon will defeat the point of using that method to get crispy skin? Would I be better to add bacon to mashed sweet potatoes, or to brussels sprouts?

I got back to our country and she broke up with me over text and it was very weird.  I never got a chance to respond.  I text her once two weeks after it ended.  I explained that I was not myself.  I figured I screwed up and moved on.  I started dating other people.

The thing is it hurts to see her name on my stories.  I feel blocking her gives her power and the best thing to do is ignore it a few more weeks and work on my emotional strength.  If I still feel the same way, I can block her then.  I have a feeling doing nothing gives me the best chance to get some closure.

I have Asperger's and ADD and I have a rough childhood.],"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 months and before that, we were best friends since about this time last year. The relationship is long-distance.

I'm 17 and I have Asperger's and ADD. I've had a kind of rough childhood. My parents have always been good to me, albeit a bit clueless. I was bullied pretty badly from K-9th grade though and I've never seen a professional about it. (I want to though) 

Anyway, I've been noticing lately that out of fear and selfishness, I've been manipulating him. I've been sexually demanding. He and I call eachother mean names, but it's always in jest. I don't mind that he has his own life and friends and that he needs time to spend alone and with his family. I always want to talk to him though and I've caught myself checking up on him before. We normally skype before going to bed and sometimes have sexytiem. I've noticed though... He'll say he wants to go at a certain time or that he just called to say goodnight, and I'll guilt/seduce him into staying longer.

Additionally, he's scared to tell me things I'm doing that he doesn't like because he doesn't think I'll take him seriously... I find myself constantly wondering how he feels, or why he does the things he does, and sometimes even wishing I could control him.

I'm sweet most of the time, but I'm volatile and tend to find myself making a production out of stupid things. 

I hate acting like this and now that I've realized it, I feel disgusting and I have no idea how to stop.

A lot of romantic tension had been building up between us and he asked me if I wanted to be in a relationship with him. I said yes! One thing led to another and we decided to take a bath together because that sounded like a cute thing to do. My bathroom is small and poorly ventilated, it has one small window which was closed. We are both pretty shy and don't have much experience in the way of sex so we fooled around a little and it was kind of an adorably awkward experience but we were both pretty nervous to be doing it at all. After a while, we decided to turn the shower on with some cool water because it was getting way too hot. When we stood up, we continued fooling around and then the next thing I know, I am on the bathroom floor with my ears ringing and he is panicked, yelling and asking if I am okay and if I need an ambulance (keep in mind throughout this whole ordeal we are both naked and dripping wet). I, at least, am mortified that my first even remotely sexual experience ended in me, unconscious on the bathroom floor.

Should I wait it out or cut it off before it gets out of hand?","I've been single for about a year now, after breaking up with the man (M30) I dated for two years. I suffered throughout the relationship - I started dating him because I was looking for attention and wasn't attracted to him, and when I wanted to break up with him he manipulated me emotionally, crying and begging me to stay with him, telling me he thought no one could love him until I came into his life etc...and it dragged on and on until I couldn't keep lying to myself and eventually broke up with him.

For the past year I've been very happy by myself - I'm honestly not actively searching for a relationship. I am, however, looking for a FWB.

I started talking to someone (M32) online, and he's pretty amazing. He fits my sexual needs(BDSM), he makes me smile and laugh and I find myself thinking about him often both in a sexual and a romantic way. He said he thinks about me in the same way.

He wants to meet me but I'm not sure what I want from him - on the one hand I like him and think we could be a good match, but on the other hand I feel completely emotionally unprepared for a relationship - I cringe at the thought of the past two years with my ex and I think I would just fuck it up with the new guy.  
I can't even imagine having to talk to someone daily, supporting them and meeting on a regular basis. It sounds harsh but my last relationship was somewhat of a nightmare to me - My ex loved to victimize himself and I still feel drained and unable to take that sort of thing again.

We were having a friends with benefits type deal. 

I don't fit in with his circle of friends, nor do I feel welcomed. His typical routine is wake-up early to go to work (5am), come back home (5pm), play video games with his friends, and go to bed (10pm). When we do hangout, it's late at night or early in the morning. I feel like I'm not a very high priority. His friends are always at his place. I don't want him to pick between his friends and me; I just want to be included in some of his plans. Everything about this frustrates me. Realistically, our communication isn't very well established either. I don't even know what I like about this guy. I love cuddling with him. 

I want a relationship; so that I can call him my boyfriend or text him/call him without any hesitance. However, I don't see the possibility of a long-term relationship. It's not that I don't trust him, it's more like I don't have the connection developed. Currently, it's better for me to not be in a relationship, due to tough college courses and academic commitments. 

What should I do now? What's the best remedy for getting over him? I'm trying to get over him. I'm limiting my contact with him. I will only text back, if he initiates it (unless I absolutely need to tell him something...which is rare). I'm experimenting how much he ""misses"" me.

I feel bad because he's trying to be supportive, and he tries to get me in the mood. But it just doesn't work. And I'm afraid he's going to think it's his fault. I always try to tell him how handsome he is and how great he is and whatnot. I don't wanna hurt his self-esteem.

We've been together for at least five years, though most of that has been through high school. Now, with me going to college and holding down a job, and her just barely holding onto a job of her own, things are different. She's still a good friend, but I don't know if I want to stay with her.

She's become even more blunt and stubborn than before. She doesn't care about preferred pronouns and names, which is a big issue since I hang around with a lot of transmen/women. She's rude to my younger siblings and kids in general. They may be little snots, but it's really not polite, to the kids or parents.

(she could've gotten a ton of grants and scholarships because she's a first-gen college students and comes from a low-income family) She managed to get a job as a hostess at a fancy restaurant. She works one day a week.

She makes no effort to come visit me or hang out or plan things, it's always me suggesting something. Whenever we hang out lately, we just kinda stay in the same room and do our own thing. She doesn't want to go to the movies or arcade with me. She has trouble keeping up with me at conventions.

This is our first relationship. We've never been with anyone other than each other. I've thought about it before, but now I'm really considering it.

So, I was logged into my porn g-mail account in the Safari app on my iPhone and I received a work e-mail.  It said that a client had shared a google document with me.  Without thinking, I clicked on the document link.  It opened in safari and it brought me to the directory of the file that was shared with me.  At the top of the screen it showed that I was logged into my porn e-mail account and viewing this google doc.  I quickly signed out without accessing any of the files.

My questions: Can other people who have access to this file see who viewed it just now?  Did I make my porn e-mail a registered viewer of this document?  Am I going to lose my job?

241," I have a close female friend who I have slept with. We are going to be in contact for the next few months, and I don't know how to handle it. What should I do, or how should I handle it (or *not","Sup r/relationships. M, 20, here. Recently slept with a close friend. Very platonic, have both dated numerous other people during the course of our friendship. The night was instigated mostly by a lot of alcohol.

 Anyway, the following morning was pleasantly un-awkward; we remain good bros (I mean this in the metaphorical sense as she is female). I have gone away for the summer, and we agreed that this is good news because it gives us ~4 months to forget it ever happened so to speak. 

But now I need advice. I don't really have *feelings* for her so to speak - we've had a bit of sexual tension in the past, but that's what the other night purely was. However, recently we've been texting, facebook chatting etc. very very often. Especially drunktexting (albeit completely platonic drunktexting). Tonight, I find myself watching When Harry Met Sally alone with ice cream after talking to her. I'm not sure A) where my typically hopeless romantic feelings are going with this and B) where I want them to go. This is troubling. 

She is a fairly emotionally unavailable person. I really have no idea what her feelings are. She told me that she is attracted to me, and was *rather* complimentary the night of, but emphasized the whole friendship thing the morning after. My female roommate thinks she's into me, and I can usually trust her judgment.

What are my options? What usually happens in situations like this? What should I do? 

Bonus points for suggestions that don't include ""Don't overthink it!"" I am trying to think sensibly about what happened, rather than pretend it did not.

242," I have a huge crush on a girl who was my best friend in high school, and now she wants to catch up after over a year of no contact. What the F*CK is going on here?","So there is this girl who was my best friend my senior year of high school. We met that year but we became really close really fast. At one point, that friendship started going in the direction of being more but it just wasn't a good time for her (still dealing with past issues). Things got kinda weird for a little while but eventually went back to normal. A few months later, things went to complete shit. 

She way overstepped some boundaries, combined with repetitively taking advantage of my interest in her. Then, I handled it completely wrong and tried cutting her off, hoping I'd finally get over my feelings for her if she wasn't around anymore. For almost a year after, I dealt with her sending extremely mixed signals, even though she said she'd give me the space I wanted. I also made it worse because I was extremely inconsistent. I claimed I wanted space but would never fully block her and reply when she'd try and contact me.   

EVENTUALLY, I think she just kinda gave up and we have not spoken in well over a year. We are now juniors in college, go to school about 2000 miles away, and the only interaction we've had is a few likes on some form of social media. 

However, I woke up this morning to a text from her (she sent it super late and I was asleep). It's kinda long but she basically said she misses me, hopes I'm doing well, and that she would love to facetime or something if I was willing to. I replied saying thanks, hoped she was doing well also, and that I'd enjoy catching up sometime. She read the text fairly fast but just ignored it. Like, over a year of nothing, she sends a late night text, then ignores me when I respond. What the F*CK?

243," I feel like my girlfriend is testing me for clingyness and that it makes her happy when I'm around a lot. Is there something to it and if so, is it recommendable to ""play games"" as in pulling away slightly?","Hi,
when reading up on relationships online, one common theme I find is that many people recommend that a guy should never become too available in a relationship. This means that they shouldn't meet up with the girl too often and shouldn't be too quick to always go along with what the girl wants (meaning saying ""no"" more) etc.. I've also been warned about giving my girlfriend too much attention or too many compliments and many of these sites also talk about ""shit tests"" that girls supposedly perform on guys in relationships. This basically means that they allegedly test a guy for clingyness or similar ""weak"" traits. Ultimately, these websites claim, such behaviour is supposed to lead to the girl losing interest/attraction.
Do you guys think there is something to this? And is it recommendable to ""play games"" as in pulling away slightly?
I'm asking because I've been seeing my girlfriend of 1/2 year almost every day lately and I somehow feel like she was a little distant recently. Maybe im just imagining it though. We talked about a similar topic a week ago and she said that she actually wants me to be a little clingy and that it makes her incredibly happy when I'm around a lot. A few days before that she had gotten worried because she thought that I was being less affectionate than usual.
If I compliment her a lot, see her often and tend to go along with things she is interested in, mostly because I enjoy them too, should I cut down on it?

245," I was told there were laws being broken at a non profit rescue center, but there were actually laws being broken by the traveling portion of the organization. How do I get my name cleared so I can work with the cats again?","Here's the story. Several years ago, I did some volunteer work with Great Cat Adventures, a (supposedly) non profit rescue center for large cats. (lions and tigers, no bears, oh my!) the organization was shut down in 2010 for, what I was told, financial reasons. Since then, I have been looking for any other organization to get on board with for love of the animals, citing my work with GCA as a reference. 

Here's the rub. As it turns out, GCA was actually shut down for animal welfare violations. I had no idea there were laws being broken, as it was the traveling portion of the organization that was breaking the rules. The ""industry"" is all aware of the real reasons for the shutdown, and just about everyone involved with GCA has been blacklisted. 

How do I get my name clear so I can work with these animals again?

Since we have been married we have had 2 other children together with the older daughters being high school age now.  Basically what we fight about is how the biological parent protects their child when they get into trouble and tries to stand up for them.  If my daughter does something wrong and get into trouble with my wife (her stepmom) I always seem to try to get a bit upset and stick up for my daughter in someway, I try not to but it happens.  My wife also does the same thing when her daughter (my stepdaughter) does something wrong and I get on her about it.  Wife never thinks I punish my daughter harsh enough and it also seems to me that she doesn't punish her's harsh enough.

After going on birth control pills my sex drive dropped to almost non existance - which I understand is hard for the other partner. However I've fixed that and gotten it under control. The problem is that during the time of no sex drive, my boyfriend would get very angry with me. He demanded that I not fake any sort of passion or orgasm, but also would get very angry that I wasn't passionate enough. He would get sulky and frustrated and be nasty for days, saying he didn't want me to consent to sex if I wasn't going to be into it. Then he would get nasty because we hadn't done it in a while, so I would then do it even when I really didn't want to just to make him happy. He would then be satisfied for a while before again he would say i wasn't passionate enough and then get angry and close off again. This happened repeatedly for a while, and now I'm to the point where I'm never wanting sex because to me it's not intimate anymore, no matter what I do it's not good enough, and I'm just a sex toy to him. The problem is that he's getting back into his ""you aren't passionate enough"" phase after guilting me into sex twice a day for the past week. He knows how I feel, but he turns any time I try to talk about it back on me, making me feel bad for not being passionate enough and feel bad for not giving him enough sex even though I really don't want it.

Yesterday he gave me an ultimatum and is making me choose. I walked off and rang the girl as she is really helpful. She told me that if he is acting this childish then it's a difficult one. I agreed and we came to the conclusion that we would stop seeing each other but resume in a few months. 

I told the lad this and he didn't take it well, he's asked me to think about it more and come to a conclusion. He stated that he could still be my friend but not as close as he was because he sees me getting and it reminds him of his ex and he doesn't want drama. As a lot happened over the past week, she hurt me a lot but I decided to give it another chance with her, as we both feel strongly towards each other. 

I can't decide. I just hope that siding with the girl isn't the wrong choice.

263," I want mediums to be the most available size at retail stores, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Is there a reason for this, and if so, what is it?","There's no way I'm alone with this problem. I'm 5'11"" and weigh 165 lbs (I'm a male). I wear medium shirts, and 32 x 32 size pants. I don't consider myself short or tall. Every time I go to buy a shirt, it seems all the sizes remaining are smalls, larges, extra larges, or even extra extra larges. This drives me absolutely mad, especially after finding a shirt I love. Doesn't it makes sense that since the height of our population follows a bell-shaped curve with the medium sized folks making up the majority, that clothes manufacturers should make more mediums to send to retail stores than other sizes? Am I wrong about this? What does reddit know about this phenomenon?

264, I met her parents and they don't want me to be her bf. What can I do to gain their trust again and be allowed to see her in their home (or at least help her with her homework)?,"I am [M19], she's [F19] and we both had not any relationship before. 

So we were not (and we still don't are) very expert in this. However we also use this relationship as away to grow together. 

Here comes the problem. Some months ago I met her parents. I didn't handle the thing very well and it ended giving them a childish image of me. (for clarity. I wasn't disrespectful or something similar. Let's say I made silly jokes etc) 

So obviously they don't want me to be her daughter's bf. 

Now I think I can say to have changed. I'm more mature and I understand that they want the best for her, that's mean someone who can make her happy and can take care of her. 

The main problem is to gain again their faith. They won't allow me to go to their home, even in order to help her to do some homework as we're classmates.

Literally. Every day. 27 days straight. 

Some days, he'll text me when he wakes up in the morning because I'm up before him. Other days, I'll text him around the lunch hour because I know he was sleeping in.

Once one of us initiates a conversation for the day - we talk until one of us goes to bed. There may be some pauses throughout the day - but the texting is pretty frequent. 

I've admitted to liking him, he's admitted to liking me (though, not in so many words because that's just 'how he is' - not very open).

We were talking until about 1am Monday night when I fell asleep. I texted him the next morning continuing our conversation. No answer. I texted him again later in the day to tell him he was being boring - no answer. Now it's the lunch hour two days later and still no answer.

My roommate wakes me up at 5:30 saying that he's drunk and wants me to park his car for him. Okay. I wear some pretty thick glasses but decided to leave them inside. Mistake #1. Walking outside in my boxers I look at the situation I was put in. The car is about a foot away from a prius facing downhill. I get in the car and recall that he has no interior lights, specifically where what gear you are in is illuminated. Half-asleep I put the car in neutral instead of reverse. Mistake #2. I make contact with the back of the Prius. Heart-racing I scramble to find reverse, then putting the car in drive. I am now partially UNDERNEATH the Prius. I finally back out, hopefully no harm done, and park the car on the other side of the street down the hill. 10:00 am the next day... I wake up to two pissed off middle-aged men asking if the gold Corolla down the street is mine. I strongly replied that I have no idea who owns the car. They then told me that the parking pass in the window has our address on it. Sweating. ""Well, we had some friends spend the night, let me see whose it is."" I go inside to collect my thoughts and prepare for the impending doom being that I don't even have a driver's license, or money to pay for the damage. I walk outside to find that I blocked an old man's driveway. He was not happy. Apparently this guy's biggest pet peeve is that very thing. I get the keys and move the car telling the gentlemen that a drunk friend must've made a late night parking error. They even somehow ran my friend's two year old dealership tag and told me, ""Tell Shawn that his license has expired too son."" Thanks ornery grandpa I never had.

Also so many of them just completely throw caution to the wind (literally) when they go out. Tornadoes are so unpredictable and wild that if you aren't skilled in what you're doing--you could kill yourself. The best way to chase isn't to get as close to the storm as you can without getting sucked into the damn thing. There are so many ding dongs that go out there and clog up roadways or get stuck because they went off-roading or down a dirt road in the rain.  

I respect and am greatly indebted to the people who are out there doing it the right way. (Yes, this means the great Tim Samaras who tragically died doing RESEARCH.) I know that storm chasing is extremely valuable to being able to seal the gap between what radar says, and what is actually happening. We NEED storm chasers. There are some that do what they need to in order to keep people safe.

Background.  We've been dating for a year and a half.  She's 22, I'm 24.  It has been a really great relationship, we trust each other.  She knows about all the significant relationships I ever had.  Last weekend, she was at a bar and she ran into a girl we both knew from college, a girl I had hooked up with.  That night, she called me (we're in different cities at the moment) and asked all about how and when I knew this girl.  I told her all that, but she started getting agitated and finally asked me if I had hooked up with her.  I reluctantly told her I had and now she's demanding to know every single person I hooked up with.

She says that night, she just ""felt really intuitive"" and thought something was ""weird"".

I don't feel that it is fair to demand all of this from me and I just don't want to talk about.  None of it is relevant to us now and for me, its all in the past.  She has hooked up with fewer people -- two total.  I know about them both, but not because I asked or felt I needed to know.

271," I met a girl in college, became good friends with her, now she avoids me and gives me the cold shoulder. What did I do wrong and how can I make amends with her (or at least get her to tell me what the hell","Okay, here goes.

Met a girl in college and became pretty good friends with her. There was never anything romantic going on, and we didn't hang out too much, but we were very friendly and put on plays together in the theater department. As time went on we both became members of the local community theater and continued to work together there. 

About a year ago, she started acting a little less friendly. I worried but I just assumed that she was going through a rough time or something. As time went on, she became more and more distant - but just toward me. She'd avoid eye contact. She'd give big hellos to everyone else in the theater and a simple ""hi"" to me (or she'd just ignore me). Now, she only speaks to me when she absolutely has to for show reasons, and it tends to be very blunt and curt. Last night at a rehearsal, she met eyes with me for just a moment, and the look she was giving me I can only describe as revulsion.

After last night's rehearsal, I decided I should figure out what's going on - starting with a text to her boyfriend asking if he knew if I'd done something wrong. I'm good friends with him as well (in fact, better friends than I was with her) and they had been dating since before I knew either of them. I figured if I had done something she would have told him, and if he felt like responding he could. I haven't received a response from that as of yet.

So now, I'm really upset with myself - I have no idea what I could have done to offend her so badly, and what would merit this behavior for so long (and why her hostility would increase over time). I would confront her directly about it, but what if I did do something terrible without even realizing it? I feel like if I had done something and been oblivious then confronting her would make it all the worse. We work with each other quite frequently, so resolving this on good terms is important to me, both in a business and personal sense. What's more is I tend to be good friends with practically everyone I meet; it makes me really unhappy when I offend someone in any way.

I had wanted to take latin ever since I began to read the Asterix and Obelisk graphic novels. For those of you that done' know, Asterix and Obelisk is set during the roman empire, it's fairly light hearted and follows around 2 celts, Asterix, a smaller guy and Obelisk, a huge rotund guy. 

Anyways, every year, the different language groups all come together and put on a festival type thing showcasing the language and culture for the languages we were learning.

I'm a chunky white kid so I fucking love bread and cheese. Nobody else was making any suggestions so I raised my hand, Mr. Melee called my name and I said ""Let's have an orgy!""

His eyes grew a little wide and most of the kids turned to look directly at me, some laughed out loud, I heard one of the older girls say something like ""Oh, gross!"" I had no idea what I did wrong, I thought that somehow all of my classmates hated bread and cheese. The teacher knew what I meant but still had a hard time getting the class quiet after that. One of the kids explained to me what the *other* meaning was and I flushed beet red and had my head down for the rest of the class.

283," I got caught in a stairwell with a girl in a dress and a guy in a tux in downtown Atlanta, principal saved us from being locked in a stairwell for hours and a rooftop fuck session on the way out of the place.","I'll start. Senior prom, downtown Atlanta, get to the door to go in, principal says I'm not allowed inside because she was a fat bitch (whole nother story in its own). After raising absolute hell for a minute it started raining and they shut the doors. So me and my then girlfriend have a few hours to kill so we decide to just walk around the city...in a tux and dress... Which was not a good idea. After a few too many bum encounters we decided to walk into this outdoor shop/business office kinda fuckin thing. After exploring the place for a little bit we found a propped open door to the stairwell. (apparently they were doing work down in the parking garage down there. But we walked up the stairs TO THE FUCKIN INSTANT ACCESS ROOFTOP. And of course super smooth high school me suggests we fuck on the rooftop. I recommend this to everyone whenever available (came off the side of the building haha) so we after that, we make our way back down the stairwell and try to leave but of course all the doors lock from the inside. So we're panicking, thinking we're locked in here for a while. So after about 15 minutes of chilling in the stairwell (not going down to the parking garage, too many workers and official city people who would not have been pleased to see two teenagers running aroun his construction zone that late) but anyways, after losing all hope fuckin Randy Random comes walking out of his office after finishing up some overdue reports or some shit. I see him, feelsgoodman.jpeg. Bang on the door, he opens the door just takes a look at us giving me the duhfuq look and I just give him a wink and say ""Great prom. Thanks for saving us bro"" and walk back towards the prom. We almost miss the party bus back but everything turned out just fine, couldn't have asked for a better senior prom.

284," I was in a group of friends, we excluded someone, I continued to hang out with said excluded person because I didn't want to feel worse, and I was ashamed of myself for doing so. I stopped communicating with the people who were making the","I'll start, when I was in highschool, grade 9, I had a started with a very close nit group of friends, around 6 of us. We had all gotten to know each other the previous year in one class, and before then, I honestly had 0 friends, so that year in grade 8 was a great one for me. 

So anyways, throughout the first year of grade 9, we would all meet at the start of the day in one location, relatively away from populated areas, and just hang out and talk before school started. Eventually somehow, and I'm not sure who suggested it, but it was brought to my attention that we were apparently considering not hanging out with one of our group members. I have no idea how this came up, and apparently we somehow made a consensus, so our one ""friend"" at the time, who we could see walking across a large field to get to our hangout area, would start to approach, and we just migrated away from wherever he was, he would cut us off, and come in a side door to the school or something to meet us, and I assume he figured we were just moving somewhere else each time. Eventually he started to figure it out, no one was really talking to him, we got quiet when he showed up, etc. He stopped meeting us at the area after a bit, and much to the relief of some of the other friends in the group. 

 I have never felt more disgust with myself than at that time in my life, I just went along with the group, and didn't question anything because I wanted to belong I guess. Low and behold a year later we ended up deciding to do it to someone else in the group, and the same sort of thing happened, except I continued to purposely hang out with said excluded friend because I still like him, and I didn't want to feel any worse. Eventually I figured out who was making the decrees to exclude people, and stopped communicating with that person. The group kind of split in to pieces, and I'm glad I'm still friends with the people I am. So that's the most ashamed I've ever been of something I did in my life, and I ensure that I won't repeat it whenever I can.

When I closed on the house I got a one year home warranty for about $500.  I have successfully used my warranty twice before.  Once they came out to fix our disposal, which they replaced with a new one.  Great.  $75 paid.  Another time they came out to tell us our heater was not broken and they couldn't do anything but gave some helpful suggestions to reduce the noise.  Great. $75 paid.

Both times prior to that I was able to speak with a representative to schedule the service call.  This time I called because my rain drain was clogged and I needed to have it cleared before fixing my gutters.  I could not get a representative on the phone.  They moved to an automated system to place service calls.  I tried multiple times to try and talk with someone.  In the end I used the automated service.  The plumber came out, looked at it and said he would call it in to the warranty company.  He came back and said it's not covered.  I tried to hire him outright to do the work but he did not have the right equipment.  Then he asked for the $75 service fee.  I said that I didn't think I should have to pay because we could have addressed that it wasn't covered through the initial phone call.  He said that I didn't have to pay it.  In the course of our conversation he also said that he knew on the service call exactly what he was coming out for and agreed that they knew ahead of time that it wouldn't be covered.

I have now received a bill from the home warranty company.  Low and behold there is a phone number to make payments where you can actually get someone on the phone.  I spoke with two separate employees and explained the situation in detail to both.  The first employee said that he completely understands and that he would need to transfer me.  The second employee said that I am fully responsible for the $75 because a service call was placed using their automated system.  There are no supervisors to talk to.

287, Boyfriend is confused about his gender and doesn't want to talk about it because he doesn't have all the answers yet.

There isnt any inappropriate behaviour or crossing of lines and if there is he sees my concerns and he makes the necessary changes for me to be comfortable. But recently we got into a fight over this and he broke down saying it wasn't the right time to tell me because he doesn't have it all figured out yet.

Basically he told me he is confused about his gender even though he knows he is straight and not trans. He identifies as male but because of his up bringing he has come to hate men in a way. His father walked out when he was young and a lot of the older men in his life when he was younger were criminals and disrespectful to women. He was raised by his mom, grandma and aunt so he does just naturally feel more comfortable with women.

He said he likes to feel like the older sister to his female friends and give them life advice and listen to them. I told him I would support him and love him through figuring this out but I am kind of scared. I do not know what to make of this confusion he keeps talking about. He said he doesn't want to talk more about it because hes not ready. Any advice to ease my mind a bit?

I transferred to a new college and did a new student/transfer student program which allowed me to meet some people and move in early.  The 3 people, 1 guy 2 females, I met during that program are now essentially my best friend group here at school.  We are always hanging out and doing everything together, so its a pretty tight group.  

At first we all lived pretty seperate untill the next year we all moved in to a dorm together.  It is a hotel the school turned into a dorm building so I live in a hotel room with my male friend while the 2 females live right next door.  We have a door in between our rooms as it was one of those conjoined hotel rooms.  (We did this on purpose so we could all live ""together"")

I had a gf when I first transferred to this school, however it was pretty obvious there was a connection between me and my friend, the 20F, that I now live with.  We always flirted a lot, I felt, but of course did not do anything as I was taken. After I broke up we still chose not to do anything I assume because we did not want to jeopardize the friend group.  Now that a summer has past and we are all back together and now living together, we have kinda kicked it up a notch.  Hooked up after a party with minor drinking, and have since been basically in an unspoken relationship.  We act like a couple imo, but nothing has been spoken between us as far an official relationship goes.  

I want to know if anyone has any insight on if I should go for it or not.  I do not want to break up our tight group of friends but I do like her a lot.  Anyone have any experience in this?

Im in a happy relationship with a beautiful and loving girlfriend whom I really get along with. She's beyond anything I ever expected from a girlfriend, and I'm really happy she's with me. 
However, she sometimes gets sad and anxious and cries if our conversation somehow makes her talk about her past. Note that I've never bothered her with details or forced her to tell me about it, it's just something she really seems to regret. I've tried to diplomatically coax it out of her, but she's worried I might get mad and break up with her (we've been going out since April this year, more or less) since I'm her first boyfriend that hasn't treated her like crap during the relationship. She's told me a few things, like the fact that she had friends with benefits before we went out on our first date and that she maintained them for a bit afterwards, and I've explained I don't care because she has obviously learned and changed but also because at that point it wasn't clear if we were dating or not. 
I'm not concerned or worried, and I'm confident she never did anything that I have a problem with. I asked her about things I'd be mad about and she told me she never did them, like hard drugs (or soft drugs for that matter) or something awful or get raped or anything like that. The fact that I'm not comfortable with some ""expected"" sexual acts might be part of it; I don't really like oral sex and I usually like keeping things normal with her, and she's told me she doesn't mind.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about a year now, but we have previously dated in the past for about 3 years before taking a small break. 

A few months ago my girlfriend visited a friend at a college and attended ""DayGlow"" a rave/festival/electronic dance music type thing that tours at colleges. She ended up getting wasted very early on into the night and hooked up with some kid on the dance floor. I did not attend the festival and found out a few days later. 

She confronted to me about it and we had an arguement as I have loved this girl since early highschool and nothing like this has ever happened before. Trying my hardest not to end the relationship I established a rule that we weren't allowed to drink without our SO present, something we both agreed on. But lately, I constantly find myself asking her if she's drinking whenever she goes out to a BBQ or someones house. 

It's hard to cope when someone cheats. I have heard on /r/relationships that being too drunk isn't an excuse and merely don't like the idea of her drinking without me because of the fear of something like this happening again. She thinks it's slightly controlling but I am slowly working on building trust again. I completely trust her, I love her, but I do not trust her drinking without me there. Am I wrong? Am I taking this the completely wrong way?

We talked about it in the morning and she denied it and said it shouldn't be a big deal even if she was since I hold my privates in the morning sometimes (not masterbate though).

Has anyone ever been in this situation as her? Tonight we had sex twice, and less than half an hour later she was doing it right next to me.

My trust in the system is at rock bottom since college and I can't help feeling highly skeptical of the companies I'm working with. Allied Interstate is the collection agency and Navient (Sallie Mae) is who it's owed to.

Today I was trying to call Navient and being transferred from department to department trying to confirm that the numbers matched. I didn't want to find out that Allied Interstate wasn't covering every part of the debt owed, and it really creeps me out that Navient repeatedly tells me they don't have access to that information since handing it off to Allied Interstate. I have one last number to call tomorrow morning and was told all they can confirm is the number of accounts, which is at least something.

My next worry is trusting the collection agency. My experience with collection agencies so far is that they'll say any manipulative thing they can to get a dollar. I was a little curious why the person helping me kept telling me that tax season was a good time to settle but wouldn't specify why, acting as though it was some secretive info. The pressure to take the deal within the week comes across as a scummy tactic as well and makes me think they're trying to slip something past me.

Last I'm having trouble finding out what to expect tax-wise after I go through with this. I've heard of people getting hit with a huge tax bomb on the forgiven amount of the debt. I'm currently unemployed and my income for the last year was under $10k. I'm hoping that's somehow taken into consideration, but have no idea who to ask about this.

My girl friend of 6 months (lets call her Marry) and her best friend (lets call him Seth), have been in a rough patch for about a month or two and I've been watching their relationship fall apart. Naturally I'm the one caught in the middle of it. I live in South Dakota (insert massive grumble fest about lack of nerds and fast internet) and they both live in Indiana so I can't sit them down and talk to them both face to face. 

Now Seth is one of my closest and dearest friends and I actually met Mary through him, but last year he went into a relationship that both I and Mary advised against separately (we didn't even know about each other at that point), but it basically turned him into a self pitying monster who can't get over his ex even a year later. He only seems to talk about himself and he's basically a shell of the guy we both grew to love. Over the past two months he's been getting really sensitive to anything we say (Mary and I are both smartass gingers with extremely strong opinions. Also worth noting, both of us lack the brain-mouth filter so things tend to just come out). He is refusing to admit that he's being overly sensitive and keeps saying that what we say and do are hurtful, even though it's a known fact that we're smartasses who tend to speak then think. 

He's actively refusing to accept that his ex left him and move on, and when both of us approach him about it he gets very defensive when we talk about how both of us were engaged to people who left us. He keeps saying that it's different and that our arguments are invalid. 

How do we, Mary and I, deal with this? We both are sorry for his loss, but he's nowhere near being the person we used to love and putting up with the constant complaining is slowly taking it's toll on our relationship.

I do great with Noah when I have him alone, so there's not question that I am fit to be a parent.

But I've talked to a few family members and close friends about this and I'm getting the drift that they think I'm not thinking soundly about adopting. A few insisted that I will find someone new and I just need to heal from my divorce. But I know that's not the case because I've gone through counseling and still go from time to time. I just know that I can provide a loving home for a child and there are so many children that need a stable home and if I don't want to be in a relationship, why should I not have a child? 

Isn't a single parent home better than many of the situations they would be in?

What can I do to get,"Long story short my former roommate, Rhea, and I were both subleasers on the original lease. Things got really out of hand which eventually led to just her and I being in the apartment and revising the lease to be just us. The former leaser, Lacy, decided she wouldn't get a sublease for her portion of rent and her parents would just pay her portion. 2 months before the lease ended, her parents changed their mind and left us to fend for ourselves (after claiming we had no proof that they were supposed to be paying - Lacy stole the contract her mother made us sign so we really didn't have a way to prove it after that. Yes, I know we should have made more copies). Rhea and I both come from poor families and worked minimum wage jobs part time while being full students, so we had no way of being able to cover Lacy's costs. This ended in court fees, back rent, and late fines that accumulated to over a thousand dollars. 

Rhea moved back home and decided the debt was out of sight and out of mind. The leasing company did not make efforts to contact us about it until almost a year later, telling us they'd send it to collections if we didn't  pay it. Rhea decided it isn't her problem anymore and won't help me pay it off. I can't get accepted to sign another lease because of this and I don't have the money to pay it on my own. I'm running out of options as my lease (I'm living under the table with a friend) ends in May and I won't have a place to go afterwards.

TL;DR: I was dating a guy who had a dog that","Obligatory this actually happened years ago, when I was 16.

At this stage in my life, I was sneaking around dating a 36 year old (another pretty massive fuck up in itself, but that's a TIFU for another day) and so I would make up excuses to leave the house and spend time at his apartment whenever I could get away with it.

This guy had a dog that was a bigger asshole than even he was; I usually love dogs but this little bugger was an overly energetic miniature pinscher that was constantly horny and humping everything he could get at. 

Anyways one day, I'm at his house on one of our illicit trysts, and things get heated and my pants and underwear end up on the living room floor while we retire to the bedroom. When I return to the living room to get dressed, I pick up my underwear and the entire crotch area is soaking wet. At first I'm confused but my then-bf explains sheepishly that his dog probably had a field day drooling all over my underwear. I laugh and shrug it off, reaching for my pants and figuring I'd just go commando, only to discover that the entire crotchal region of my pants was again soaking wet. This dog was some freak.

At this point, my bf offered me a pair of his boxer briefs as a barrier between my crotch and the dog drool, and so I wore them home under my pants, and stuck them in my underwear drawer thinking nothing of it. 

About a month later, I happened to leave my underwear drawer open as my dad wandered into my room, and saw the men's boxer briefs chilling on top of a messy pile of other undies.

Now, I also have a grandmother who loved to come over and compulsively clean and do all the laundry no matter how much we tried to get her to stop, and my boyfriends boxer briefs were apparently the same brand of grey Calvin Klein boxer briefs in size small that my dad favors. He noticed the boxers, decided my grandma must have sorted the laundry incorrectly, and grabbed them to put in his own drawer. Sorry, dad.

Some background: I'm 25, just out of Uni. 6 months ago I started living and working in UK and am currently earning ~£1.7K a month. 

My parents live in Poland now and are terrible with money. It started by my grandfather not being able to take any more loans so he asked my father and mother to take loans to have their business afloat. From what I know they have taken about ~£250k in loans and the debt collector wants to sell their business.

It seems that according to them it it's my turn to 'chip in' to the family business in order to save it. They would like me to take a loan equivalent to about £32k so they can pay off this debt collector.

My mother told me that she is planning to pay off this 'new' debt in two years but somehow I don't believe her. I know that I should not under any circumstances take this loan for my family and ruin my credit history and probably my whole future. On the other hand this is my family and it seems that this company is the 'last chance' for them.

It was really bad early on in the marriage, but the last few years things she has gotten a better handle on it.

I honestly had not thought anything of it, bc really its some dumb school project that i need to go on autopilot to complete.  She wants me to tell the group I wont be involved and to switch with another guy in the group.  Problem is all the other group members have filmed their parts.

So she went on facebook and stalked the girl and she is really freaking out and I can tell her insecurities are bubbling up to the surface again.  She told me she is shocked and disappointed that I dont see a problem with this situation.  It's weird for me bc I didnt see any problem with this until she started crying.  She sees life and interprets things much differently than I do.

Met this girl a while back. Long distance friends for years. We talk all the time, I saw her a few times on weekends and holidays, but not much else. 
Within the first few months of talking to each other she said she got an odd feeling talking to me because we're so alike. It is kinda odd, our thought processes even tend to follow the same patterns.

So we slept together* on the couch. We'd slept beside each other before. We'd even had our episode of drunken makeouts before. Twas a bit different this time. Just felt different. 
We woke up and stayed laying there for like 4 hours holding eachother and talking about random bullshit. At one point she tried to roll over towards me fall asleep. While she did that, she stopped about halfway through and we made eye contact. Her eyes shot straight through mine, and right out the back of my skull. I was in a trance. I could go on and talk about that forever, but I won't. Either way - she stayed there staring into my eyes for a good 15-20 seconds before she finally completed her roll, resting her head on me and hugging me as she tried to nap. 

That's all I've been able to think about for the past 48 hours. I feel pathetic. 
I can replace engines and transmissions in cars. I can program in a bunch of different programming languages. I race cars. I competitively lift weights and do sports. I can't handle emotions because I'm not used to dealing with them.

323," I'm not happy with my life right now, she says she will understand whatever decision I make, but how, where and when could I tell her that I don't feel like I'm enjoying the relationship as much as before, but not breaking her","Hello Reddit,

She and I have had a really stable and long (for my standards) relationships, you could say we were our first couple (in bed) for each one, our relationship has been really good so far, we've shared so many happy moments, we laugh a lot when we're together. But like a year ago my feelingS for her are not as strong as they used to be, I like being with her but I don't enjoy it as much as I used to, I get bored soon when we date, sex is good although I think she enjoys it more than me. 

Last week she was feeling sad because we weren't seeing each other often (She traveled for a week, then I traveled for a week and she thought we were going to be together that week and had huge plans), she asked me if I was happy or if I was bored, I told her that sometimes I don't feel like I'm enjoying the relationship, but wasn't brave enough to admit it in a direct way, she asked me to think if I wanted to continue, she says she really loves me (she does, more than I love here, sadly) and will understand whatever decision I make.

I've been thinking in a way of saying it that I won't break her hearth, I wouldn't forgive myself if I do that, I need the time for my personal projects and to define my future, since I'm not happy with my life right now, being alone would help me to think that.

So, dear reddit, how, where and when could I say this to her without breaking her heart?

Forget to add, when we started I was still in the university, I graduated 2 years ago, she's still an student. I suppose we see things in a different way.

When I brought it up to my wife, she wasn't too happy.  It's not that she doesn't like them, she is just stressing out that so many people will be in our 2000 square foot home and that we have to feed all those people (financially it isn't a concern, she is just stressing out).  Another reason she is concerned is because she thinks that my family likes these people (who my family has known twice as long as her) more than her and she feels out of place I guess?  

In essence, what should I do?  I personally don't have a problem with it, but my wife is stressing out and is causing unnecessary stress on our relationship.

My question is how do I stay neutral in this?? Clearly, this is going to affect my friendships, but I really don't know what to do as far as being able to give advice to either of them about one another and talking about their sexual encounters (something that is regular conversation with both friends). Is all of this off limits now?  Should we establish ground rules - if so what? I don't want there to be he-said she-said or the like, but I'm not sure making all conversation about the other best friend off limits and cutting out a huge chunk of each friendship is the best approach.

We first started dating about a year after I broke up with my long time girlfriend of 5 years who I never really got over. After that break up I chose to become a very emotionally distant and cold person on the inside but very happy and all around nice guy on the outside. Which has brought me to my current issue. I thought that I would eventually be able to move on past my old relationship, cut off contact, deleted all pornography, etc... but unfortunately I have not been able to despite everything that I've done. 

I've talk to my fiance about that several times about how I feel and she has been very supportive but I can't help but feel that I am not ready for marriage and would like to break up with her. She really deserves someone who will be able to reciprocate the love that she has for me. I've talked with her about ending our relationship in a calm manner and it usually leads to her crying and begging me not to leave her but I am not happy despite there being absolutely nothing wrong with this relationship. 

I've gone to speak to a professional about this and have been diagnosed with depression and they have recommended that I end the relationship as it is probably not the best idea to be in one in this current state of mine. I'm just not sure how to end this, everytime I've brought it up it ends with me staying and being miserable. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I started hanging out with this freshman girl I befriended when we were touring the campus of the college we now both attend. I had pretty much zero romantic feelings for her at first, but as we hung out more I found myself falling for her. In hindsight though I acted really stupid about it, being completely oblivious to any hints she was dropping (turning down offers to sit next to her, saying ""no thanks"" to borrowing things, etc.). Of course at the time I thought everything was going smoothly, so soon enough I worked up the courage to ask her out. Two days after she turned me down, saying that she wasn't romantically interested in me. 

I kept my cool and basically just kept hanging out with her in the hopes that my feelings would subside and we could just be friends, but that didn't work. I eventually started looking through relationship advice sites (like AskMen, for example) which advised that I gradually break contact with her so that I'd just forget about it eventually. That didn't work either, so I went back to spending time with her, though not nearly as frequently as before I asked her out.

Currently we're both juniors (I'm a bit behind on credits) and one week into the school year, and I'm finding it hard to try and get in touch with her. The previous school year I hung out with her and a few of her friends on a couple of weekends, but nowadays I feel like I'm getting the cold shoulder.

Being two months from my 16th birthday I obviously couldn't drive, and neither could S, so we relied a lot on our parents to take us and drop us off places. Very romantic. 

S had an older sister however, who offered to take us to dinner or whatever it was we'd planned that night if I could meet them at the salon they were at, near ""Mi Cocina"".

Now what you have to understand I hated Spanish. I'd taken Spanish in middle school, but as soon as our school offered a switch to Chinese I took it. As such I hadn't spoken a lick of Spanish in two years and was pretty happy with my tenseless language based decision. 

Here comes the FU. S was part Mexican and as such was close to fluent in Spanish and often spoke in it to jab at me. When I saw ""Mi Cocina"" my mind immediately jumped back in time to middle school and recalled the only Spanish word starting with C it could remember.... casa. 

This is how me and my very annoyed mother ended up waiting for almost half an hour outside the salon near S's house while S and I talked on the phone and I repeatedly insisted I was at the salon specified.

S was cool about it when my brain finally made the connection and I went back and checked my texts but it was incredibly embarrassing. My mom was a little less forgiving and I wasn't trusted with Spanish translations much after that.

But that's being taken care of, she's seeing doctors and getting things under control.

She's still attractive to me, and the sex is still great when we have it, but I just don't want it.

Here's where my issue is coming in.  When we first started experiencing a decline in sex, she was frequently initiating and attempting to either talk about our sex life, or spice things up, and basically just finding ways to get us going.  She brought up our decline in sex a few times, worried that she was doing something wrong but I vehemently assured her that it's simply my sex drive and has nothing to do with her.  She kept trying and I love her for it.  But now in recent weeks it seems like she no longer cares.  She isn't trying to initiate things anymore, isn't being overly affectionate, doesn't ask if I want to join her in the shower, etc.  

I hear these horror stories about deployments and cheating wives.  I don't want that to happen to us.  So, I want to spend the next few months fixing this and reigniting some spark for her.  But now that she seems less interested, where do I start?  I guess she has always been the one who initiated sex and intimacy so I don't really know how to start again from scratch.

We stayed friends after that but I ended up dating another girl before senior year ended because I didn't see any way for it to work with my crush and I started liking this other girl, then we graduated and the last time me and my crush seen each other it was graduation night and we smiled at each other and said bye.

My best friend and maid of honor graciously told me earlier when we were discussing dates that I could use her birthday weekend if necessary (her birthday is on a Thursday). Turns out, that was the only weekend my venue had available in a 3 month range, so I went with it. 

I am totally not someone who thinks my wedding has to be all about me--in fact, I asked my boyfriend if we could get her a cake and sing happy birthday to her at the wedding, and he thought I was being ridiculous. 

What can I do to make sure her birthday is still special two days before my wedding? The wedding is a couple hours away from where I live, and we will be there for the whole weekend, so we will be departing for the venue the morning after her birthday. Obviously I will have a lot of friends and family in town and she has met many of them but most are not actual mutual friends (she and I have never lived in the same city!). We have been best friends for 12 years and I have not had the opportunity to spend her birthday with her in about 7 years. I am actually really excited that I will be able to next year, but I realize I will probably be super busy and crazed with pre-wedding stuff. How do I strike a good balance between honoring her special day and not going insane before mine??

Note: she is the kind of person who LOVES her birthday, just because she loves fun things, and usually does something creative like going ice skating or having a picnic to celebrate. She is totally not self-centered about it at all, just likes getting people together to do fun stuff! I'm sure she doesn't expect much but I'd like to go above and beyond her expectations because I love her!

I did the thing you are not suppose to and fell in love with one of my best friends. Yeah, I know people always warn about it but sometimes when you feel a certain way you can't control it.

 

For the past year we've been back and forth with the idea with a relationship, I won't specifically get into the details because they aren't as important. To get to the main points, she just didn't feel right but I was in love. Yeah I'm pretty young to feel these things but I've been pretty careful with those kinds of feelings my entire life and was confident in how I felt.

 

Today we sat down and had a long talk. It came down to it that she enjoys being great friends, and that the current relationship of friends is great, but that my pursuit of her would kill it. I couldn't be both, the pursuer and the friend. I decided that I'd rather be the friend. It hurt. A lot.

 

I know I am going to still be crazy about her. I told her that I am going to give us some space for a while, for my sake. I guess I just want to hear that I did the right thing, choosing a lasting friendship. I also don't know how I am going to be able to handle her future relationship endeavors with maturity. I've prided myself on being mature for my age, and living to a higher self standard, but I don't want to freak out and be emotional if she finds other guys, be it long term or short.

347," I feel like my girlfriend is cheating on me and I don't know how to feel. If anyone has similar situations, what did you do and how did it turn out for you guys?","Hi guys,

A little background... I've been with my current girlfriend for 10 months. We were great together. Sure, we had our ups and downs but we thought this was it and we were going to get married. After last night, I don't know what to do.

She used to hook up with a member of my fraternity, my friend. This was when I was in another relationship and I didn't pursue her. When we got together, it bothered me at first. He was kind of weird about it and so was I, but we got past it and plus, I don't really see this guy anymore. She always told me she was going through a phase and hooked up with him when she was drunk and it didn't mean anything. She didn't think he was attractive, I believed her and felt better.

The other day I messed up. I was in the shower and she said she got a not so good text from her long ago ex. He sent her a picture of them, she said she was deleting it. I trusted her at first and didn't really let it bother me. Then I screwed up. She was in the shower, I decided to look at the picture, I don't know why. I saw the picture in her texts and it sucked, then I got the feeling I should open her text with her and her friend.

In the text, they're talking about my friend from the fraternity. My girlfriend is the one who started the texts and was saying how good looking he looks in his recent picture on Facebook. It killed me.

We got in a fight and her reasoning for saying that is that she was showing off for her friend. She wanted her friend to think that she was cool. I feel like that is a bunch of crap and she doesn't want to admit that she was checking him out and maybe has feelings for him.

I don't know how to feel guys. I want to stay with her so bad but I feel like I shouldn't let someone treat me like that. I thought so highly of her.

If you were me, what would you do? Does anyone have similar situations they can help me with?

Basically I'm really bad at flirting and showing interest, so I worry that he thinks he got ""friendzoned."" The truth is, I think about him all the time, and I want to jump his bones! But since he's kind of reserved too, I never feel confident enough to do so.

In light of this, I decided to try initiating contact with him more often, and to try and make my interest a little more obvious. But it seems that he's not interested anymore. He usually only talks to me for a few minutes (IMs), and then suddenly has to go somewhere or do something important that cuts our conversation short.

Me: 21 year old, engineering student, fun, financially comfortable, independent.

Her: 22 years old, film grad, recently unemployed, fun, adventurous as hell, totally beautiful soul.

Hi [1] /r/relationships.

Just curious if you might have an insight I don't here. My girl and I were together for close to 18 months before she split with me in an attempt to figure her life out and be independent and do all that young people stuff. AKA not ready for anything really longterm or serious.

Understandable, I guess.

Meanwhile, I travelled throughout the US (We are both from New Zealand), tried new jobs, careers, had a small dead-end relationship.

On my return, I recieved all sorts of cutesy, kind messages of how much she missed me and such. She visited me, we got together, slept together, spent five days or so in constant company. It was amazing. Like everything I missed about 'Us'.

She convinced me to fly down to her new spot and visit for a weekend. 6 weeks later, I did so. On my arrival, she let me know she was 'seeing' someone. Yet she still kissed me, held my hand in public, snuggled up to me in my hotel room whilst watching Community and drinking wine. However she decided staying was a bad idea and since drove home to her parents place, out of town.

I know 80% of the comments here are gonna be ""Communicate!"", or ""Talk to her"". But I don't want to. I just want things to play out in my favour. I've missed her so much lately, I thought things would be the same. I guess I shouldn't have placed any expectations on this visit, but I'm left in a hella confused state. We are so good together, I would hate for something silly to get in between it.

But we are both in grad school (she worked for a while then went back to school). We moved in together in the summer. There was a hiccup during the application process for our apartment about getting a credit check on both of us and apparently it came out that there was some debt that she had that I didn't know about (beyond student loans because I have that debt as well). She gave me some sort of explanation but I made clear to her that I wanted the truth because it was a big deal. I don't remember very clearly but I do remember that she acted ashamed and embarrassed about it, but she never explained everything to me and dodged the issue. I did approach her directly about it and she gave me an excuse.

Now I just discovered that she is constantly getting calls from various debt collection agencies and credit card companies. That is not normal for someone with only student loans who is still in school. We are supposed to be building a life together but I still get the feeling that she is not entirely honest with me and my recent discovery proves it. 

I fear for my own financial livelihood to make our lives one (including bank accounts, house, and other assets). I don't feel like I can completely trust her because of this. I gave her an opportunity to explain herself before and she was not completely honest with me. What the heck do I do?

As I am grabbing the toys she is at the top of the ladder when she screams ""OH MY GOD"", she quickly climbs down the ladder and falls into the pool. I thought it was a bee or some sort of bug that was on her so she jumped in, I payed no mind. I start walking next to the ladder so I can softly toss the toys on the ground. I look down into the water and I start laughing because I still see her down there, but shes not moving. Like Pokemon paralyzed. So I grab her hand and pull her up to surface, Im laughing my fucking ass off because of the look on her face and she is hysterically crying. Im laughing so hard I almost pissed in the pool, she finally tells me she caught a charlie horse in her legs and she cant move because it hurts. I had no clue that charlie horses hurt that much, so here I am trying to hold my SO's head above water so she doesnt drown while holding her body straight so she can feel better. 10 minutes later her legs stop hurting and she thanks me for helping her.

I didn't ask before, but because we are now probably going to spend the rest of our lives together, I think you should get it done. It will mean more spontaneous sex.""

I was against the idea at first, but then began to accept it as I was the happiest I had ever been and wanted her to be happy as well. She also spoke a lot about living together forever and I became seduced by that idea. I wanted to give her a surprise, so on her birthday I told her that she could make the arrangements to have it done. I realized that I would lose some sensation, but assumed that it wouldn't be too much and I could stand to last longer anyway. Rationalizations...

Booked the consultation and surgery two weeks away. She was the happiest I had ever seen her since I started dating her. It felt like we were progressing to the next level and I considered proposing sometime in the near future. Everything was happy.

Day of the surgery:  She woke me up with a blowjob, got me into the car, and took me to the doctor. She had done a lot of research so she knew what she wanted and I just told the doctor what she told me. I went into surgery. 

She took me home and I settled down for a nap as I was still groggy from the sedative.

Met Jason in April while bar hopping for my friend's birthday. On our first ""date"" he explained that he's only looking for more girls that are friends. He wasn't looking for anything serious cause he got out of a 7 year relationship a year ago. Him and his ex broke up cause he wouldn't put her as a priority, didn't show affection that much (PDA). He feels like he has something to prove since then so he's trying to make himself better even though he fell out of love beforehand. He claims he has unconditional love for her.

So we became friends and we would talk on the phone for a couple hours a few times (drunk conversations). He would ask personal questions like what my goals were, if I believed in love at first sight, how many guys I've been with, stuff like that. Now I've had plenty of guy friends but I've never talked like this to them before. We wouldn't get deep until we've been friends for months and this went fast.

A couple of weekends ago I decided I couldn't be friends with him cause I liked him too much and knew this wouldn't amount to anything. He called me saying he couldn't loose me as a friend. And so we tried to remain friends. Last weekend he called me drunk again saying if he kissed me would I kiss him back, he likes staying up talking to me, and to come over. Well the next day he texted me saying he felt like he was leading me on and he doesn't like doing that so we shouldn't talk anymore. 

So should I go after him? I actually liked him as a friend and knew where we stood so I hate that I'm loosing a friend.

What do?","The guy I'm seeing is absolutely fantastic - smart, interesting, kind, generous -- all of it. However, he ended a six-year relationship in early May and chaos has followed ever since. To clarify, I met him on Tinder and the only expectation either of us had was to have a short fling (I recently ended a relationship too), but it developed into much more. We are crazy about each other and have been dating pretty seriously for the past 8 weeks.

What makes me most uncomfortable is his newly ended relationship. I have absolutely no contact with my ex; he tried to contact me and I told him not to call me again. My SO is different; his ex constantly calls him in tears and tries to manipulate him into coming over. She relies on him very much still and understandably hasn't gotten over their time together (and likely won't for a long time), which would be okay except it is intruding very much into my relationship with him. The breaking point for me was last night, when she happened to pass us in the car and ended up being physically violent towards him. She didn't know about me and he still has not told her we've been dating regularly. 

I should add that the two of us aren't exclusive yet. The reason we haven't progressed to exclusivity is because I want these issues resolved before starting a relationship. He assures me he's ready, but these encounters tell me it's way too soon. I feel like he won't be ready to date for at least a few months, and that I should just find someone else. I don't approve of the way he handles his ex, but don't feel the situation is as black and white as it seems. They have a long history and I know it'll take some time to figure out.

We've talked about it, and at first she rejected me, but then for a couple weeks she tried to give me what I wanted, but it was really about her giving me what she thought I deserved, not what she actually wanted, so it failed. She says she doesn't want to be in a relationship right now, with anyone, as it will get in the way of her career, but in every other sense we are in a relationship and I've become an integral part of her career (she's a filmmaker, I do post-production work). We're connected emotionally and in every other way. We talk for hours every day and we've really become each other's backbone. The only difference between what it is and what I want is physical closeness. If anything, I think adding that aspect would help her, and my, career.

Despite her saying she doesn't want a relationship, I also know people can't really help it if they meet someone who just clicks with them. That's what happened with me, but she's an incredibly strong-minded woman who is able to remove emotions from situations, and frequently cuts people out of her life for getting in the way of her personal evolution.

I feel right now that she's getting everything she wants from me, but I am not getting entirely what I want from her. I've heard countless times that the thing to do in this situation is to distance myself from her, stop giving her emotional support and just kind of take away what I've given her, and that might help her see she really needs me.

But does that really work? It sounds manipulative, and with someone like her I could see her reaction being that she just moves on and chalks it up to just one more brief relationship with someone. I'm the kind of guy that, if she did find someone else to have a physical relationship with, I would still be there being the emotional boyfriend, even though on the inside I'm dying.

Her and I[26m] dated off and on for 3 years and before we broke up for the last time I got her a position in my research lab. She is now doing her Masters thesis, as am I, and her current project is crashing and burning. She has a very high animal mortality rate. When I saw her crying in an animal facility room because of this and hearing talk of University animal services considering revoking her right to work with the animals, I took it upon myself to perform her surgery myself. Later that evening I relayed the data to her. I did the surgeries in half the time and told her her animals were under too long, and this was the cause of the deaths. She Went on and accused me of ""talking over her project""... ""trying to control her experiment""...
She went on and lied to our Principle Investigator (PI) about how long her surgeries were taking (used my data as her own). The PI didnt believe her and asked me to look into it and send him her data. I lied to him to protect her. When I asked her to sit down and talk to me about her mortality issues, lying, and leaving the surgery area in complete disarray I found that she was recording our private conversation. I brought this to my PI's attention, as it was the last straw, and he told me ""you pushed hard to get her in this lab. I will be losing money by dismissing her over your personal issues. Deal with it.""

364," I want to hang out with my ex again, but now he acts somewhat hostile towards me and I'm not sure how to deal with it. Is there a way to make it clear that I really just want to hang out as friends, and that","We were friends before, but ended up hooking up a couple of times over the past couple of months. There was a period of time where we sincerely thought that we both really liked each other and there was something there (things have always remained casual and not serious). The main reasons it ended were that his feelings were not strong enough, and that my feelings were stronger which created pressure. For me, obviously it was unpleasant, but it turned out that my feelings were not that strong and I was actually completely fine with it (I didn't feel the usual anxiety, sadness, or particular urge to contact him).

The problem is that I would actually like to remain friends with him, but after it ended I felt like his behaviors were a bit hostile towards me and I'm not sure whether and how to proceed. All the incidents are very mild but they do add up. For example, he would talk in a mildly unfriendly manner towards me, but to the point that even our mutual friends pointed out that he's being weird, or that he would be relatively cold towards me, or that he would make meaner than usual remarks about me. I'm not sure what could have prompted this change in attitude. 

It's been a while since things ended, during which I haven't contacted him (a mixture of me not feeling like it, and given his reasons for ending things I think we needed the space anyways) and he hasn't contacted me, but I'm hoping to start hanging out as friends again (coffee, dinner, movies, etc). But now I felt really uncomfortable asking him to do that given his mild hostility. If I confront him about it he would probably say that I'm mistaken (I may well be, but I don't think so). So I'm curious what prompted this attitude... A male friend of mine suggested that these behaviors might be a reflection of his own insecurities and jealousy. I have considered that idea but havedecided that even if it's part of the reason it can't be the whole reason.

~30 MPH at impact. Police report places 100% blame on other driver. 

He changed lanes into me, hitting my bike on the right side, causing me to high side. I and the bike landed to the left, in the middle of my lane. 

Bike was totaled ('09 GSXR 600 w/ slip on, new tires and a few other extras). His insurance already cut a pretty generous check for that ($8500). Currently working on remaining property (clothes, phone, computer that was in my bag, etc.). We'll see where that goes. 

**Injuries:** No broken bones or anything. My tooth went through my lip, bike landed on my legs (swelling), the tiniest bit of road rash on my left leg, bruising above my left hip, gnarly neck and back tightness along with scary weakness in my right knee and left shoulder. 

I did not take an ambulance nor go to the hospital. Limped away with the tow truck driver instead, in fear of the cost. 

I did hire an attorney (family friend; not a scum bag). 

**Treatment:** A check up and follow up from a general doctor. Some x-rays. I've been seeing a chiropractor 3 times a week for a month and will probably continue treatment for another month. Physical therapy once a week on top of that. Back, neck and knees are still not up to par. That's pretty much it.

But there came a point where we just said screw it let's date without her knowing. 

So we date. Both of us have never done anything sexually with anyone else before. So we were each others first. We didn't have sex, but we did basically everything kids do. Ya know making out cuddling oral and all that jazz.

Her mother just happens to also be crazy however. She monitors her phone shows up where ever she is and just is always in her business, so it was hard for us to date in the first place. After I graduated high school (two years older than her, she's a senior now) it got even harder. We weren't allowed to see each other. And communication is difficult with her mom monitoring everything. We found a way to communicate now, but it was hard at one point. We even started writing each other to keep contact. 

But there got a point where it was too hard for her. All the stress from keeping me a secret and seeing each other secretly and it hurt her a lot because she'd miss me and couldn't see me. She wanted to break up because she was hurting. 

After she broke up with me, she got with some other guy to get over me. She gave him a handjob. He performed oral sex on her. I was her first for everything and she was my first, and still is my only. I've only loved her. 
Today, we're together and love each other very much. But what she did with that guy keeps messing with me. I'm going insane. What do I do about that? She's a total good girl and were both each other's first. This is the girl I wanna marry. But I can't get over what she did with that guy.

The infatuation has worn off, but we're still very close and affectionate, getting along great. 

She has 2 kids, 7 and 9, boys. It was made very clear at the start that I'm not into kids and she agreed that I'm not a father figure, they have a dad, I'm just a friend to them. She's the parent in the house. She said if it turned out that I couldn't handle the kids and needed to live on my own, she wouldn't be offended.

Just about a week ago, I was talking about how I may need to get my own place. That I've given it an honest try but I just can't handle the kids (ADHD and ODD, fairly extreme cases). 

She said that would be fine, but only for a couple of years at most because a long term relationship means we have to live together. 

This is counter to what she told me when I moved in. I'm the kind of person who really prefers to live alone and I can't handle kids well. I feel a bit blindsided and it appears she and I have differing views on the requirements for a long term relationship. I could easily be monogamous with her for life as long as I don't have to live with the kids.

I've gotten my primary residence appraised at $410k and will owe $205k after the refi. I will be able to take a HELOC (Home Equity Line Of Credit) out for up to $123k @ 2.5% for the first 6 months and Prime +.25% with a baseline of 3.5% after the intro period. There is no fee for me to do this. I also own an investment property, which is worth ~$250k. The current mortgage on that property is approximately $133k @ 4.75% with PMI (I also hate the mortgage company which recently bought this loan). PMI = $70 a month.

My thought is to take the $123k from the HELOC and with $10k of cash pay off the investment property. I can pay down the $123k in approximately 3 years. This will free me from the terrible bank and reduce my interest rate. My concerns are mainly about complication and problems related to taxes. Everything I've read says generally HELOC interest is tax deductible for the first $100k of credit, but I have seen some people say that if used on an investment property, the interest of the HELOC is directly deductible from the investment property profit, even in amounts over the interest on the $100k of credit.

I could always refinance the investment property to a 15yr fixed at 4%, or a 5/1ARM @ 3.5% but that comes with upfront costs estimated to be $2k - $3k, hassle for an appraisal, and more time spent, not to mention more interest costs, but with a more simple tax scenario.

Time passes and my mom comes to wanting me to never ever be with this guy. We ""broke up,"" but remained in contact and in a relationship, but had a few mishaps as my parents caught us along our way, leading us to ""break ups"" for purposes of parental appeasement. 

My family wants nothing to do with his family. They also find me to be too ""attractive"" a girl to be dating such an ""ugly"" guy.

384," I like a girl who is in love with another guy, but still wants to hang out with me and be my friend. She doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but it's hard to spend time with her when she's on my","I need some advice. There's this girl that I like, who is aware of my feelings for her, but is in love with another guy (a friend of mine) that has a girlfriend at the moment. From my understanding, he's unhappy in his relationship, but doesn't want to leave the girlfriend just yet since he went through so much pursuing the girlfriend in the first place and would feel bad just leaving her. My predicament, is that the girl I like still wants to be my friend and wants to talk to me and spend time with me everyday the same as before she rejected my romantic feelings for her. I do want to be her friend, but I feel that we need to spend less time together. Although I've asked for some space in the past, she's made me feel guilty about it saying that she needs a friend who won't place restrictions on the friendship, so I've kind of given in to her. I feel like she is right in saying that if I want to be her friend, I shouldn't want to push her away. But it's hard having to see her everyday and not feel drawn to her romantically, though I'm aware that the dynamic of our relationship will never change, because of her love for this guy. This guy has known her for 3 years and has had feelings for her since, but because she had a boyfriend at the time, he kept his distance and chased after other girls (hence the fact that he now has a girlfriend -- they only started dating late last fall).

More Background: She and I only started hanging out when she invited me out to see a musical performance with her. From then, we started talking and at first she showed a strong interest in me even bluntly saying that she likes me. But after a good 2 months of getting to know each other, the truth came out that she loves someone else. She still wants to hang out and be friends, but every now and then she'll say she's confused about how she feels (without any prompting from me).

385, Boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me because he doesn't want to respect my boundaries and wear swim trunks when he goes to the beach with his ex-boyfriend. He feels like I'm imposing silly restrictions and that's not he kind,"Original post is here: 

I had already kind of updated that post but we spoke again last night so I figured I'd just round this up. Once again he would not budge and he passively decided that it's worth more to him to be able to do the things he likes, as long as he isn't having sex with others, than to stay in a relationship with me and respect my boundaries. He feels like I'm imposing silly restrictions and that's not he kind of relationship he wants to be in.

I sent him a text earlier today asking if he wanted to come see me. He said: ""to argue?"". I said: ""no, to call it off"". We've been together for a long time and I guess I just wanted to see him one more time. I haven't seen him in two and half weeks anyway due to the Ramadan. He decided not to visit because he didn't see the point. 
   

I barely ate anything (even after sundown) and I have this hollow feeling in my chest. I'm wondering if I made a mistake by harping on the same, really small issue but at the same time I'm baffled that he wouldn't just cop to wearing a pair of swim trunks when he goes to the beach with his ex-boyfriend to make me feel more comfortable. Regardless of whether or not something is still going on between them. I guess he would rather lose me. 

This was my first relationship and this is my first break-up. I'm very puzzled by this entire situation and I really do feel bad. It also sucks that this is happening during Ramadan but I guess those are the breaks. Thanks for listening, guys.

386, I drank my brother-in-law's piss in a bottle of apple juice and gave it to my niece. She drank almost all of it and didn't get sick. It was a very close call though.,"My wife and I stayed at my brother-in-law's small apartment to help him take care of his daughter for a few days while his wife was out of the country. We slept on the floor of his living room. In order to go to the bathroom you had to walk through the master bedroom/nursery. In the middle of the night, not wanting to wake up my niece, I decided to pee into a bottle. The only bottle I could find still had a bit of apple juice in it, maybe 1/8th full. I emptied my bladder into the jug and then set it down behind the garbage can. My plan was to take care of it the next morning.

Of course, the next day I wake up and completely forget about the piss. My brother-in-law finds it and, thinking that his daughter had put it there, picks it up and puts it back into the fridge. Since it's about 50/50 urine/juice, it doesn't look too suspicious.

Later that day, my bro-in-law fills up my niece's sippy cup with the juice and asks me to give it to her. She was super thirsty and drank almost all of it. You'd think at this point the alarm in my head would start going off, but it didn't.

Today, I wake up and open up the fridge looking for something to drink. I pour the apple juice and immediately upon drinking it realize that something terrible has happened. It takes me a few minutes to put the pieces together. I ask my bro-in-law if he had found the bottle by the trash can. He confirms that he did and I confess what happened. He was surprisingly cool about it and said that as long as she doesn't get sick or grow a beard, it's all good.

390, I've been dating a woman for 6 months and I'm starting to question my own views on dating and whether or not she is the one. Is there a chance that she is just a bit untrusting and I'm just not seeing it?,"I've been dating this woman for 6 months now and I'm starting to question my own perspective and looking for an outside view.

Key issues:

* Questions me if I think a girl is cute if I have to talk to any female during the day
* Gets extremely jealous about my women co-workers.
* We have not met once. It's been 6 months and there is always an excuse. She seems to have issues with me flying there also for some reason. I don't think she is cheating on me because we spend so many hours on the phone with each other that I don't see it being possible.
* Starts crying/panicing at the sheer thought of me leaving her. I've talked about having personal time and not talking on the phone as much and she instantly thinks I'm dumping her or trying to see someone else.
* Her past boyfriend or two have supposedly cheated on her so I've given her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she is just a bit untrusting now.
* If I don't respond to a text message within 5-10mins she thinks I'm busy talking to someone else or doing something without her and gets extremely upset.
* Got very upset with me because I told her not to take a job yet that would be in my state because I thought we should at least meet first. This got into an argument about me not believing in soul mates and stuff.

I've always thought she was pretty nice and maybe I was so hooked because she put up with me (I have a bit of an abrasive personality at times I guess). I've been alone for pretty much all of my adult life and really don't want to go back to that feeling of being alone and I think because of that I'm being naive with my views.

391," I tried to buy tickets for our flight from Japan, ended up buying tickets for a train to the airport instead. And then ran across the biggest station in Tokyo to get to the terminal in time for our flight. ಠ_�","This fuck up happened two years ago on a study abroad program to Japan with my BFF. 

We had our exit strategy somewhat planned out, got our flight details in order and left the dorm at a respectable time to get to the train station, buy a bus ticket for Narita (the same way we came), and fly home. 

Little did we know that the bus service only ran til 6 and tickets were already sold out by the time we got there. We completely forgot about buying tickets ahead of time and we were pretty much fucked if we didn't get on that flight. 

So we went straight to plan B, get a train ticket to the airport instead. Sounds easy right? NOPE. The ticket machines were all in Japanese and nobody spoke enough English to help us. I somehow managed to mime my way out of this and got us two tickets for the next train out. It was arriving in 10 minutes. 

And then we discover that the terminal was at the other end of the biggest friggin station in Tokyo. So there we were, two smallish Asian girls (5'5, 110lbs max) with three bags each, hauling ass across the vast expanse of the station and sea of polite Japanese people probably wondering what the f was going on. With a trolley bag in each hand, my BFF ran ahead of me and parted the way like Moses and the Red Sea while we continued to startle random Japanese citizens. 

We made it on the train literally 5 seconds before the doors closed. It started moving while we were still standing by the doors, drenched in sweat and about to pass out. 

Two years later we find out that the terminal was just across the street from where we were buying tickets ಠ_ಠ

I should probably also point out I don't have health insurance and my state won't give medicaid to you unless you get disability or are over 65. GG NC.

Anyway, this morning I was getting ready to take a shower and when I took my shirt off from the previous night, I noticed my breast had a huge red spot. This definitely scared me. Then I noticed what looked like a blister. It had like a thin layer over it that looked like over-skin or whatever. Anyway I rubbed my thumb over it and it removed the skin. I am pretty convinced this is a blister.

So I took my shower and figured I would show her after the shower. To show her I got in bed and covered the bits I wouldn't want to show her so I could just lift my shirt and show her what I wanted to.

I showed her and she is freaking out quite a bit. I wasn't thinking.. Her grandmother died when she was 48 to breast cancer (my mom was like 4 or 5), so I guess the idea scares her. Genetics, you know. Technology is a lot better though.

I am not saying I have breast cancer, I'm sure it is nothing. Just a sore. But I shouldn't have showed her because she had a really hard time with it. 

at least I was smart enough to not tell her that it feels like a bump right below it. Which I'm sure is just because of the blister itself. 

Anyway I put gold bond on it per her request and I'm sure it will be fine.

395, Boyfriend was mugged and has become very withdrawn and nervous around others. He says he doesn't mind me going out without him but I feel bad leaving him behind and would like some advice on how to deal with his new personality.,"My boyfriend was walking home late at night about three months ago from a friend's house when he got mugged by some teenagers. They stole his wallet and phone and beat him up badly enough to get him in the hospital for a few days. I've been trying my hardest to support him through this period but it has put a huge strain on our relationship. We've been together for around two and a half years.

We tended to be pretty outgoing but because of the incident he never wants to go out. When friends invite us to things he always comes up with an excuse not to go. He says he doesn't mind me going without him but I feel too bad about leaving him behind to enjoy myself so I've more or less stopped going out. His libido is also way down, he used to initiate all the time and we had sex usually at least once every two days mostly more. These days he rarely initiates and we can go more than a week without it. I know that doesn't seem like much but it's a lot for us.

He spends a lot of time moping about the house, and when we do go out he always seems on edge and nervous around others. He's even had a few panic attacks when we ended up staying out later than intended and were walking back in around the same area. Honestly I know some of you might not like this but I have to be emotionally honest, I'm finding him much less attractive at the moment. He used to be a fearless guy who took risks but now he's always so nervous and less open to trying new things.

You know how Facebook has that feed of ""people you may know"" on the side bar? One time I saw this beautiful girl on there, she really caught my eye. I clicked, because well, what is a beautiful girl doing on my ""you may know"" list? Turns out she is a friend of one of my friends that I don't really talk to. That friend is a girl in a committed relationship that actually resembles a couple of 60 year olds (they turned really boring when they started dating. If I'm invited over, I may go, maybe not. Point is, a bit of a disconnect with the mutual friend)

I asked her about her once told her how I saw her and thought it was weird and asked if she thought it was. She said yes (she's also a bit of a prude so I'm not sure I should take that as solid evidence) and kind of laughed about it, saying the girl came over once and really just trailed onto something else. I told her she should invite her to her next get together (I said I planned on making the next one anyway because I felt bad missing so many) This never really happened.

So my question is: Although I'd hate to use Facebook as a first meeting, would it be weird if I messaged her saying how I had seen her and that I couldn't help but try to reach out? I am much, much better at not appearing creepy in person than I am on the internet. Granted... that's mostly thanks to the internet itself.

We mutually like each other and get along, but I think I prematurely asked him to dtr after quickly becoming physical. He says he wants to be my boyfriend and believes that we're already in a relationship now, and mentioned that he's willing to be exclusive with me. But then he goes on to say things like he's scared of relationships, doesn't see the point in labelling, and is not sure of how to be a proper boyfriend - whatever that means. I can sense that he carries a bit of baggage and got hurt from his previous relationship, and I found out that he still talks with his ex (though I don't know the depth and breadth of that connection). 
Whatever relationship we have right now is still quite young, and he's a busy guy, so I get that he might need a bit of time to sort things through with himself. He tells me not to worry, but I feel like I have nothing to keep me afloat. He is not very emotionally demonstrative, so it's difficult to figure out what he's really trying to say but I do feel that he was being honest and appreciate the honesty for telling me the above.

TL;DR: Grandad was in hospital, family went","As with most fuck ups, this wasn't today, but 13 years ago, right before my teenage years. My grandad was taken into hospital for what we thought wasn't something overly serious. He'd been sick before and been to hospital, only to be released a few days later, so this wasn't uncommon.

Around this time, my Mam had trusted me enough to stay home alone in the house for a few hours at a time, which was a big deal to me. I come from a big family, and being in the house alone was cool and something different at the time. It was also nice to be trusted in that way as well.

Two days after initially going into hospital, my family went to visit my Grandad. I was asked if I wanted to go, or if I wanted to stay at home. I asked my Granny and she said she thought he'd be out soon and I could see him then (not placing any blame on her whatsoever, merely telling the story as it happened). Her tone and general relaxed belief that he would soon be out made me feel like it wasn't overly serious. I decided to stay home and also mind my younger brother too. I could watch TV, play Xbox, etc uninterrupted, things which somehow I felt were important at the time.

Fast forward a few days and his condition worsened. I begged my Mam to let me go to the hospital to see him, but she said she didn't want me to see him in that way as it would be a bad way for me to remember him. I was so upset at the time by this, but looking back I can appreciate why she did this for me.

Roughly 10 days later he passed away, and I never got to say goodbye to my Grandad, somebody I loved so much.

404," I told my ex of 2 years that I had a miscarriage and had a great bonding moment with him, but now I'm moving across the country and don't know how to support him through the tough time he's going through (or if I even","I was with this guy for a few months when I was in college. Right after we broke up, I found out I was pregnant and then had a miscarriage before I figured out what to do, so I never told him. We had somewhat of a messy breakup and both were seeing other people for most of the time since then, and I cut off all contact with him, although he tried to reach out to me a few times. I recently found out I'm moving, so I met up with him this last weekend to let him know what had happened. 

It went really well, he was awesome and supportive and wished he could have been there for me and was glad I had told him. We've both gone through some rough shit recently and it seemed like we had a great bonding moment, and got along great even after almost 2 years of not speaking. 

I know the way I dealt with what happened is very different than what he's going through - I had two years to process it and I just kind of dropped this bomb on him out of nowhere. I know it's a lot, and I'm wondering how I can best support him right now (or if I should at all). He lives pretty far from me right now, and I'm moving in a few weeks to the other side of the country...where he will also be once he graduates in a few months. He's seeing someone now, so I'm not even sure I should try to talk to him at all about it. I don't want to interfere.

405," I feel bad that I think of splitting up with my boyfriend, but there's nothing wrong with our relationship. Is it wrong to feel this way? Is it wrong to feel bad about wanting to split up with someone who is otherwise perfect for me?","Bf and I met years ago but reconnected and started dating four years ago. We've lived together for maybe two years and have been in our own place a few months. 

Everything runs generally fine. We have our hiccups every now and then but we talk them through and things are resolved. 

I'm sorry Reddit, but I'm so bored. I love him, I truly do, but my gut tells me it'd be a bad idea to stay with him and that I'll never be completely happy. 

I'm not sure if my reasons are petty. For example, our personalities are similar but different. I am a very outwardly happy person, where as boyfriend doesn't show his happiness or emotions much. I enjoy cracking bad jokes or being silly, and as much as he jokes with me sometimes, sometimes he'll just give me 'a look'. My brain tells me I need a partner who will dance with me in the kitchen or have water fights in summer, whereas he won't do that. Or anything 'fun' really. 

Also, he doesn't value time together as much as I. He's happy to cook dinner together and that be our time spent together, whereas I would prefer to play a game or watch tv together or go to a movie or something. I've tried talking to him about this and we'll do one thing and then it's back to normal. I can do it his way, sure, but I know I'll never be completely happy with it. 

I think things like this and feel bad. Our relationship is generally healthy. I can talk to him when I have issues, he supports me and loves me etc. 

I think I got roped in on the honey moon phase when he was the person I wanted and then got sort of bait and switched. But it's made me fall out of love, but is that important to keep? I just feel bad that I think of splitting sometimes even though there's nothing 'wrong'. 

Please can I have your advice?

406, I broke up with my girlfriend of a year because she said she needed to be happy with herself before she could be happy with someone. She is now dating someone new and I feel completely lost and confused. Anyone else have a similar experience?,"I am not really looking for advice or anything like that. I just wanted to get this off my chest and ask if anyone else has had a similar experience. 

Recently my girlfriend and I split after about a year of dating. Our relationship was very good. We had a ton of fun, rarely argued and never fought. About two weeks ago I dropped her off at home and noticed she was a bit distant, I asked her if something was bothering her. She told me that she felt like she needed to be single. She is in love with me but felt that she was only happy when we were together, when she got home or if we didn't see each other that day she felt lost. She said she needed to find herself as a person, she needed to be happy with herself before she could be happy with someone. 

Some back story here, I was there when she broke up with her previous boyfriend, consoling her and whatnot. We have known each other for years. Things escalated between me and her and shortly after we were dating. We both knew that she needed time to be single however we made the mistake of not giving it to her. 

Currently, she says she isn't looking to date anyone, and doesn't know when she will be ready to date again. She didn't want to rule out us ever dating again but we both know that we cant wait for each other. If we are in the same points in our lives some time down the road maybe we will get another chance. Its a difficult situation for both of us, and it has completely devastated me. I miss her more than I ever imagined. I have had longer relationships and I've had shorter ones, but this break up has hurt more than any other. It confuses me that two people can be so in love and yet it still may not work out. 

I respect her for being strong enough to go through with the breakup knowing how she felt about me. I hope she finds what she needs. This is just another testament to the awesome power of a human connection. The greater it is the more it will hurt, but it makes you feel alive.

408," Girlfriend gets upset when I decline sex, but doesn't want to feel that way, and doesn't want to feel that way because she doesn't want to feel that way. What can I do to make her feel better, or at least not","A few times recently, my girlfriend and I (6 months) would be cuddling when she tries to initiate sex. I've declined a few times, which would lead to her being really upset, and sometimes crying. I asked her about it and assured her I was still interested in her, and she said that she would probably react similarly in the future until she gets over it. She really doesn't want to feel and think that way, but she says it will likely happen anyways. I don't want to resort to having sex with her anyways if I'm not feeling it, I don't like doing that and I don't want to do it anymore, but sometimes it seemed better than making her feel sad.

409," I have no experience with dating and i have no idea what to do with a girl who is flirting with me but sometimes ignores me, and sometimes hangs out with me, and sometimes ignores me again, and again, and again, and again,","so i'm 16 as stated above, In my short few years on this earth i have had 0 girlfriends i flirt with girls a lot and they generally flirt back but i've never actually dated anyone mostly because of low self confidence 

there's a girl in my school who has been a acquaintance for a year, when i met her she was dating the hottest guy in our school who is a year older than us, plays guitar, and is friends with everyone that i have ever met because of his charming personality

she says that he's ""only a friend"" now and even though she's very popular i think he's out of her league so i can believe that

lately she's been asking a lot about me, and trying to hang out with me at any chance she gets, usually loudly exclaiming ""I'M GONNA GO SEE ANON"" to her friends before she walks towards me, they usually laugh or ignore her, she then either chats with me or ""helps"" me out with school even though she knows for a fact that im smarter than her, though i guess the fact i have no idea why she's hanging out with me says that she's more socially knowledgeable 

her friends said that we're a ""cute couple"" because im about a foot taller than her, when they said that she laughed and said that they were a cute couple too. they are actually dating, unlike us

i have no idea what to do, i like her but im scared because the last 5 girls i've asked out have shut me down even though they showed signs they were flirting (laughing at everything i say, touching my arms and chest) i dont think i've been ""friendzoned"" because then we'd be friends and not weird people who flirt and touch each other a lot without ever actually going anywhere

i think the thing i have the most trouble with is the fact that some times she follows me around and flirts a lot while other times she completely ignores me, a mutual friend told me that that's normal but i don't like the lack of stability, as you can probably tell i have a lot of social anxiety but i can usually play it off without letting it show through

410," I have a lower libido than my girlfriend, and it's causing me to lose interest in our relationship, but I don't know if it's because of my lower libido or because of deeper problems in our relationship. What do?","Yes, sex is important in a relationship, but it can be difficult when your partner's libido is higher than yours. My girlfriend is a wonderful girl; cute, funny, and understands me in ways that nobody else does. 

However, as of late, whenever she gets in the mood, about 80% of the time I'm just not feeling it. From the start, she has always been way more easily excited than me. I can't do anything even mildly sexual, like playfully biting her neck, without her wanting to jump my bones. I used to just go along with it because I do enjoy sex, but now it's just annoying. Sometimes, when she wants to have sex, I'll just make up some excuse or ignore her repeated requests until she forgets. I almost feel like I'm being pressured to have sex when I don't really feel like it and thus I'm a little resentful, and it's starting to build up. I'm not depressed or extremely anxious about anything. I'm also young and in good health and I don't take birth control of any kind, so as far as I know, it's not due to any hormone imbalances or anything like that either. 

For a bit of context: my girlfriend, Sarah, and I have been together for almost 2 years this August. She makes me happy for sure and I love her, but lately (this is the very short version), I fear that I'm losing interest or becoming bored of our relationship, almost as if I feel like I could do better, but if I tell her this it will break her heart. She has joked before about the time when I ""find someone better and leave her"" and I had denied it, but now I wonder if, deep down, she was afraid that one day I'll start to think she doesn't deserve me, and if she was right all along. 

What does that have to do with anything? Well, it's a chicken and the egg scenario; am I losing interest in my relationship because of my lower sex drive, or is my lower libido only a symptom of deeper problems in my relationship? Is this a classic case of ""lesbian bed death""?

411, I have no experience with dating and I don't know how to go about finding someone to date. I have a lot of free time and I feel like it's a waste to not use it to meet people and get experience with dating. Any tips,"Hi, I have more free time than I should so I decided to make a post.

I'm a 21 year old male, and I've never really been in a legitimate relationship. I had my first girlfriend at summer camp when I was 12, but it only lasted about 2 weeks and I was 12, so I don't really count it.

I had my second ""girlfriend"" in 11th grade, when a friend of mine told me she knew a girl who was interested in me. I ended up calling her after we had talked for a little and asking her if she wanted to be my girlfriend (in retrospect horribly awkward idea). She said yes. We never actually went on a date, but we kissed a few times and she broke up with me via text message presumably because I seemed so disinterested. I never really committed to the relationship and I didn't really care about progressing the situation.

Now, I'm in college. It's my third year, and I haven't really had any kind of relationship at all. There's the occasional drunken hookup at a party or another kind of social event like that, but nothing ever goes past that. I've just never pursued a relationship, and because of my complete lack of experience, I don't know how to go about looking for someone. I'm fairly good-looking (not being immodest, just saying that appearance isn't something I think is holding me back), I am very sociable, I have a good sense of humor (I even perform stand up comedy occasionally) and I'm easy to talk to. I just don't know what to do when it comes to relationships at all, and I feel like it's really weird that I've never really had one. Any advice?

She's coming to visit family and friends here and has brought up wanting to stay at my place with her son (her husband will be staying with his friends because that's how much their relationship has gone sour). I said okay at first, hoping she'd stay where she usually does (her mother-in-laws, where it's already childproofed and is a large house, as opposed to my one bedroom apartment where my bf and I live - with no kids). 

She keeps mentioning new things, like her son tearing apart her clothing (holy fucking strong much), peeing in her bed, torturing their pet dog, and apparently now he can open doors - I have houseplants, and well - just a lot of stuff - that I have no fucking clue where I'm going to put when she visits, especially seeing I have no locks on any doors.

We got them both litter trained early on, and things have been perfectly fine for some time. But about six months ago or so, one of the cats decided to poop on the bathroom rug. We got it cleaned up, cleaned the litter box (we thought that was the issue), and shrugged it off. A few weeks later, it happened again, this time on a different rug. Then again, and again, and again. It's gotten to the point where she's going outside of the litter box about 25% of the time. (Only when she poops. She always pees in the litter box.) And she's going pretty much wherever she wants when she does it. Bathrooms, living room, kitchen, you name it. It's enough of a chore to clean up the litter boxes regularly, especially with two cats. We can't handle doing it on the floor, too.

We've tried practically everything we can think of. We cleaned the litter boxes more often, we changed the litter (several times), we got new litter boxes, we moved the litter boxes around a bit, we tried working on diet stuff, nothing has worked. We haven't been able to find any cause for this, and it's simply getting worse and worse with time.

This was my first time seeing her since they had dated & we had gotten back together. I know that they are still friends because of mutual friends and I knew that she'd be around for a bit.

I've been with this girl (let's call her Sarah) for more than a year now, and me (19M) and her (18F) are in a fight about something. Well this something isn't really a little something to me.

A little background:

She dated a girl (let's call her Bitch) a few years ago, and had a pretty serious relationship with her for a couple years (some not so wise things), and they stopped talking after they broke up. Sarah had hated Bitch ever since then. They play roller derby together, but kind of mind their own business.

The problem:

About two months ago Sarah started talking to Bitch again, and they decided they didn't hate each other anymore. They became best friends again and now talk about whatever they want. Well, seeing as though she is her ex, and Sarah hated her, I developed a hatred for her too. Well, therein lies the problem. I asked Sarah if she would stop talking to her and she said no, and I even threatened breaking up with her and she still said no. I get ignored by Sarah when I'm with her because she talks to Bitch so often. I can be having alone-fun-time with Sarah and she'll pull out her phone to text Bitch and ignore me. While on Skype with Sarah I quite often get blasted with the sound of Sarah's keyboard while she talks to Bitch on Facebook.

423," I don't want a relationship, but I don't want to date either.  I'm not sure if I'm just tired of dating or if my desire to date has just dwindled to nothing.  I don't have game either. ","First off, I'm not going to blame women for all my problems in the dating world.  The gods know I had my own share of fucks-up and I've messed things up permanently with a few women that could've gone somewhere serious.  So I shoulder some of the blame and I accept that.

I'll be honest though, in the past year, my desire to date and to have a relationship has lessen to a point where I don't care if I have one or not.  I dunno if the idea has lost is appeal to me and I'm becoming more comfortable with becoming a lifelong bachelor or if I'm just tired of the whole process.  

I will admit, I have never been a social person outside of the internet, I hang out with friends once in awhile, go on trips, but for the most part I'm a loner and I think that's why I have the social grace of a sledgehammer.  I also have the subtly of a sledgehammer.  

That's most likely the reason why I don't have ""game"" or why the idea of ""tweaking your online profile"" so that she'll be attracted to you just doesn't appeal to me.  I'm not the guy who list unreasonable demands, I'm not bitter (I'm actually happy with my life right now) and I'm not trolling for a one night stand.  I-I just don't see the point in trying to ""smooth out the rough edges"" just to find someone.

I'm in the right lane coming up to a small intersection with a green light for me. A truck or SUV to my left makes his left turn then.. I see a dude just walking into my lane from my left across the road, my brakes are slammed at this point. He walks in the way of my car causing him to get hit. He didn't touch my windshield but left a small dent on my hood. He was jaywalking the road the whole time. I did not take pictures bc I wanted my car off the intersection to avoid traffic.

He moans and groans and worries about not being able to work. Witnesses call cops. I move my car off the intersection. Cops show up. Firemen show up. Ambulance takes him away. He only had scratches on his legs and elbow according to the paramedics. 

Witnesses agree that I had the right of way and that guy was an idiot for causing danger to himself and others like that. Cops were pretty fast and helpful and made it seem like it was not a big deal. Received no citations.

I didn't break the speed limit and was passing a green. I reported the situation to my insurance and they'll be talking with the police and the other party as well as check out my car. Moments like these I wish I had a dash cam. I feel like the guy was committing insurance fraud, or drunk, or mentally ill, because why else? What's the most likely outcome of all this? Best case and worst case scenario?

I always figured because of money he would be better off being put down. But I cant do it! I dont want to live life without him. I feel as though it would save a lot of heart ache if I did just let him lie easy. Maybe I am being cheap. But even if he is better in the morning, its only a matter of time before it happens again.

429, I've gained muscle and my girlfriend has gained weight. She's unhappy with the results and has made no effort to lose it. She's now obese and has made no effort to lose it. It's affecting our sex life. She's unhappy with,"Sorry guys, I'll bet you get this kind of thing a lot. I'll try to keep it brief.

About a year ago, my girlfriend confessed that she felt that she would be more attracted to me if I gained more muscle because I was 'a little bit too skinny'. It caught me off guard a bit - seeing as she was always saying I was gorgeous, but nevertheless I agreed to bulk up. It was something I was hoping to do anyway.

A couple of days into my new routine and diet, I suggested that she work towards a similar goal. She was only bordering on overweight then, but she was still very sensitive about her weight. Naturally, she got upset. I basically argued that it wasn't fair that I should have to put effort into improving my body when she didn't. She eventually agreed that she'd try to lose weight (she was always saying that she wanted to prior to the arguement). 

She agreed to try to get her old body back and that she'd cut certain things out of her diet as I had.

To cut a long story short, I haven't quite attained the goal I set out to achieve, but I'm close. I'm now fairly lean and muscular. She couldn't be happier with the results, but she hasn't made any progress towards her own goals. On the contrary, she actually put on a significant amount of weight. She's now obese. While I've been adhering to my new diet and exercise regimen almost perfectly, she's been eating chips and chocolate. Her diet has only gotten worse over the year and she's made little to no effort to work out either.

Every time I've brought up the fact that she agreed to meet a certain goal, she gets angry and upset at me. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that she'd put at least half the effort into maintaining her appearance that I do. Anyway, as I'm sure you can imagine, it has been affecting our sex life quite a lot. I didn't mind when she was chubby, but I've never been attracted to obese women. It has been upsetting her that I've been less and less enthusiastic about sex, but I can't help feeling less attracted to her.

She recently just graduated and started working for one of those big four accounting firms. Due to the huge work loads and excessive overtime, we rarely manage to find the time to skype or talk to each other. as a result, the distance that never used to be part of the problem started becoming one.

At the same time, i was facing alot of pressure as 4th year university student and I started lashing out, i hurt her verbally many times, and it was always for the same reason : I cant stand her always going out with her friends to clubs or rave events without me. She has been going constantly every weekend since she started work, and every time she insists that it was because of her friends and that i can trust her . Also it didnt help that she is such an open person and has so many male colleagues at her work place which added to the jealousy.

Slowly all this builds up, causing us to quarrel more. One day, which was supposed to be our 4th anniversary, i pressured her to to make the decision, whether to break up or not. She cracked and said yes, she wants to break up. At that time, i was so tired from all the jealousy and the fact that she forgot our anniversary it made me to stupidly think i cant do this anymore. the other factors was, she doesnt want to move to the country i am in now, and religious reasons.

I'm good at English, she's good at Chinese, though we can both speak the other language, except more poorly.

Problem is we don't understand each other sometimes. She doesn't understand my (western) humor and teasing, and she speaks/texts more with her circle of Chinese friends. She feels more comfortable talking with them. I'm about the only person in her life that is more American than Chinese.

And yet she chose me as her boyfriend.

Sometimes I don't know why. This is something I'm often wondering whenever we have a lack of conversation. Why does she want to be with me if we're not talking that much and can't find much common interests? Is it because I'm tall? Is it because she feels like she is at an age where she must find a boyfriend now? She's even planning to go back to China after graduation, and she knows I won't be going with her long term.

Sometimes when we're texting, I often ask her a question and she responds once. And then the conversation doesn't go much further until I ask more questions.

We both like each other, but it seems like I can't find much common interests between us. We've known each other for about 1.5 years and been together with her for 3 months.

I feel like we have a big language and cultural barrier between us, and I don't know if there other reasons why we're not talking very much. Since we've only been together for a short period of time, is it best to continue observing?

So I'm 17 and between my Junior and Senior year. My friend hooked me up with this cool job as a bellman (guy who carries bags, etc) at a hotel in the city a little ways away from our town. I interviewed, got the job, and began training in the last few weeks of school.

I trained one weekday when I had the day off from school, but I was not able to train any of the other days they suggested because I was still in school. I told my supervisor this. When school was finally out, I contacted my supervisor and let him know I was ready to continue training. He was a little peeved that I hadn't gotten back to him/kept him in the loop about when I'd be finished with school.

 I count that as strike 1 for me.

Strike 2 was my real screw up though. I had a tentative trip planned for the entire month of July, and, perhaps scared I wouldn't get the job, I never mentioned it to my employers. So there I was, a little over 1 week away from departing for this trip, and I then decided to let my supervisor know I'd be leaving.

Well obviously he didn't like that, and a couple days later, I was asked to bring in my uniform.

**My Question/Concern:**
Because of my short time there, I never collected a paycheck, but I racked up 20 hours of clocked time working. I plan to discuss with my (ex)supervisor about retrieving that paycheck, but is there a chance I may run into trouble in trying to retrieve it? Could they deny payment to me for those 20 hours I worked because I failed to give them 2 weeks notice?

i'm not bragging. our finances are mostly joint and we pay very little money to rent a room in a friend's tiny house which is ultimately shared among 4-5 people. it's not terrible, but it was intended as a temporary arrangement, and i hated the loss of independence in going from an apartment that was *just ours* to a place where i need to hide to get some personal space (plus all the other standard ""roommate complaints,"" dishes/food sharing/etc.).

what i'm saying is that we put just enough money in our joint account to cover bills, gas, and food for us. we don't go out to bars, we don't go to concerts, we don't do... anything. we went on vacation once and that was only because his parents were willing to share their cabin with us. 

we've talked about this many times before and he agreed with me that experiences are far more valuable than things. i want to travel and be a citizen of the world with him!

i feel like we're trapped in this house with no hope of independence, travel, or even a rainy day fund because of his purchase. he's hurt that i don't trust him to handle this. i know he will be responsible and pay it off, but i'm convinced it comes at the cost of actually improving our lives. i can't pay for our wedding alone, i can't take us on vacation alone... i have $600 to my name after a year of saving.

i've already voiced my concerns, but only gingerly, because what good would it do? i don't want to hurt him. but i never wanted this. we could have gone on ten vacations with that money. we could have had a down payment on a house! he will definitely have it paid off in a year, but that's a year we could have been saving...

Her parents were against it initially but after meeting them, they were happy about me being the guy. However, they wanted things to be finalized(read: engagement) as they didn't want us to simply 'date'. I postponed it how much I could(since I am studying+working and I think her father doesn't treat her as an adult) but after they spoke to my parents, our engagement is in April. 

My elder brother [6yrs gap, unmarried]and relatives feel its too soon and maybe she's not as 'mature'. Also, the circumstances 'her father giving me a take it or leave it offer' didn't go down too well for them. Relatives (and bro,maybe) feel that I could have waited for him. Although the dust seems settled now, I believe at the time of the engagement, they will feel that she/her family is immature/demanding, from their POV. 

We're from different countries (same origin) and while my family has seen a lot of turmoil and come out of it, her family seems to have seen green pastures and have a nice time throughout. 

My question is, how can one classify someone as 'mature' or not? Also, how much does it matter that the person is 'mature' to begin with engagement and marriage? My gf said she was ready for marriage since she was 20 (her parents had a young marriage) and I'm more than willing to turn my life into a two-player co-op. 

I love her a lot but I think her father is too overpowering, and that has hampered her growth. I wanted her to experience life on her own before getting engaged/married, but it seems that isn't a possibility. Is there a 'right time' to get engaged?

442," I was dating a girl, ended badly, now I have a new girlfriend, but I still have feelings for the first girl, but not as much as before, should I contact her to be just friends again, or is that a bad idea?","Basically we were dating for a few months, it all ended in a pretty bad way, basically she got back with an ex of hers. Prior to this, we were friends for years, talking since we were around 5 years old. However due to the situation she basically left me in, I decided I didn't want to speak to her for a while, not while I still had feelings for her and she was back in a relationship with an ex. I was really hurt, so when she tried to ""catch up"" with me as she didn't want to loose me as a friend, I told her I cant and I dont want to see/speak to her for a while. 

Fast foward to today, I have been dating someone else, started a new University met some awesome people and I have calmed down over her and I feel nothing much at all towards her anymore. So should I start contact again, purely in a platonic way. Before shit happened we were really good friends... I'm not sure what to do?

443," my girlfriend has major depression that affects me, and I want to learn how to deal with it better so that we can both be happy. Is there any way to learn to deal with her depression better, or is it a lost cause?","I've been with my SO for two and a half years now, living together for one and a half. She has had very rough life which resulted in her developing C-PTSD and major depression. Her C-PTSD makes her behave like someone with BPD, which was her main diagnosis until very recently. 

Basically, she used to be way crazier than she is now, but after starting a DBT program a year ago she has improved ten fold. All that really remains is the depression, minor mood swings (no more significant splitting), and a total inability to handle minor/major stress in day to day life. This means that she is loving and happy when nothing major is going on, but as soon as she has to work/go to school she becomes very depressed for a variable period of time. 

It is almost like I have two girlfriends, the amazing one I see on breaks/weekends/vacations, and the negative, irritable and depressed one I live with all week. I used to struggle with depression, so when she get's depressed for an extended period of time it is very hard for me to not get dragged down into being depressed myself. It is very very difficult to bring her out of a depressive mood, so my only options are to try to ignore it/not care, distance myself from her, or get sucked into it with her. Obviously, none of these are very good options. Is there anything I can do here that I'm missing? I'm very bad at these things. Honestly, the only things I've found that keep me from not getting depressed as she unleashes a barrage of negativity on me about small every day things is to 1. try to think of something else 2. mentally build a wall around myself 3. be under the influence of drugs/alcohol 4. leave and do something else. Is there any skills I could be doing to make myself less susceptible to it? or is this just a ""get used to it or leave"" kind of thing? any and all advice welcome.

444," I love my girlfriend, but her parents refuse to let us live together unless I convert to Islam and marry her. She is an athiest and hates the city we are in now. We are stuck in a bad place.","My girlfriend and I have only been seeing each other for six months but have fallen completely in love with each other. We have seen eachother almost every day through the last six months and have been on a vacation to a different country together already. Everything is absolutely amazing and I couldn't ask for a more satisfying relationship.

But there's an elephant in the room. Her parents are Muslim and refuse to let us live together unless I convert to Muslim and marry her. My girlfriend is secretly an athiest, as am I.

My girlfriend really hates the city that we are in right now. She has been all over the world and recently moved here for her sick grandpa. We met the day she got here and have been together since, but she hates this city because of the lack of creative outlets she has and the horrible vibes it gives her. I'm not a fan of the city either.
She really wants to move back to Canada, which is pretty much impossible with me because we can't live together for 12 months to get me immigration status because of her parents.

So basically, we are stuck in this city that makes her miserable, living in two different places (she's with her grandpa now.) and we have this huge deal of her parents overbearing rules looming over us. We shouldn't have to talk about marriage or any of this so early.

I know it sounds so crazy because I haven't known her for more than half of a year, but I really truly love this woman. I want to stay with her more than anything but I am very proud of my open mindedness and want to live my free spirited way forever.

The way I see it, we have the problem of either me being unwilling to convert to a completely foreign religion for this woman, or we have her being unwilling to tell her parents that she will make her own decisions and live a life with a non-muslim man.

Any experience with this is extremely welcome. I feel so alienated and alone because I don't know what to do. All advice is welcome.

I have no experience with girls and I have no idea what to do next.","Ok I'll give some background info to start off. I'm a complete newbie when it comes to romantic relationships and girls. I'm a virgin, never kissed a girl, and never even held hands with a girl. I used to be pretty scrawny and weak, but a year and a half of bodybuilding has dramatically changed that, I would call myself very attractive now. I've gotten better at conversation and socializing over the past year after watching and practicing videos from RSD Tyler and Elliot Hulse. So I've been getting better at life hopefully, but I'm not sure it's made a difference.

This girl that I've been crushing on the past year or two is in one of my classes this year (senior year of highschool) and today the class was cancelled. I went to the library and there she was, and she said hi. We chatted and I went to sit down at a table, and she sat down with me. Instead of working, we just talked for an hour about life, college, school, miscellaneous stuff ect. 

I felt ok, I was a bit uncomfortable I think, because nothing like this has ever happened to me before, and I think she was ok too. I saw her a few times later today and said hi then too. 

So I'm asking, what does it all mean?!?! 

It was a casual conversation, but maybe she was flirting with me? Would we be able to do it again? Where should I go from here?

I have a lot of unanswered questions since I know nothing about girls. I really like this girl, so I don't want to screw this up. If anyone can provide some ideas or insight, or need any further information let me know.

This is my first time posting here obviously, so please be gentle. Thank you very much!

if we moved subbie and miley into a new house where it is no cat's territory, is there any chance subbie won't be so hateful towards us/miley? the two cats have never met before but i can't leave either of them behind.

447," I may have to go to basic training and won't be able to contact my girlfriend for several months. Should I break up with her now, or hope for the best? (she may even be abroad for a while).","Me and my GF are both seniors in high school and we are getting ready to graduate (future plans, college apps, blah blah blah). We have been dating for a few months now and its been great. 

However, I've come to the realization that we both have very different life plans and we may possibly not be able to see each other for several days or even weeks and months at a time.

I plan on enlisting in the Air Force right out of high school and have to go to BMT and AIT and won't be coming back home from June until around Christmas.

My GF plans on visiting or even possibly temporarily living in the country she's from over the summer which is from May to September (maybe even longer, depending on her plan). Then return and attend college in state.

That being said, we won't have communication with each other for at least a solid 3 months. Even after that time period, contacting each other may still be difficult.

For right now, our relationship is pretty stable. It's sometimes fun, sometimes stale. However, she constantly talks about how much she misses where shes from and that she'd rather live there than in America, which saddens me. We have a few similar interests, but we are very different in the end. She has stated a couple of times that we are very incompatible, which saddens me even more, but it's true. 

Plus she likes to smoke, but hasn't since she moved to America. However she plans on smoking and drinking with her friends when she returns to her homeland. I absolutely HATE people smoking. Drinking is cool. However she gets hammered after one shot so I'm a little afraid of that when she's abroad.

So, my question is: **Should I break up with her now, before we separate, or hope for the best?**

Note: We are of the same ethnicity. I'm Americanized, she's not..if that helps. I also love her very much. I just don't know what to do. I just want to make the best decision for myself and for her.

It's very difficult for me to","I have a group of friends and over the time of our friendship, i realized I don't have much in common with them. I am very motivated in terms of my education and always felt guilty every time I used to go out drinking with them etc.

They are the type of guys who talk shit behind everyone else's back, drink and smoke excessively, and never really study for their degree.
I'm the opposite infact, I rarely drink much, don't smoke, and am very motivated to get as high grades as possible.

I noticed over the past year of 2 there is some snickering and exchanging of glances occasionally when I am talking. When I started noticing it more, i gradually stopped hanging around with them as much, as i deeply felt hurt and anger at their behaviour.

One of the guys is in my class, so it's not like I can completely withdraw from them. He irritates me too as I have done him favours and helped him with work (and he has also done some stuff for me too) but he's one of the ones laughing. They used to always call me to hang out and stuff but after I noticed them laughing at me, I kept declining to chill with them, so now I only see them around uni, which is almost everyday. 

It's very difficult for me to open up around them as I am pissed of at them, so they think I'm just this completely closed off guy, with no sense of humour and awkward to be around. I see them around uni and stuff so it's not like I can just not hang around with them (I have 3 years of school with them) and everytime we have our small talk I end up going home with my blood boiling with anger. Either they are exchanging looks with each other in my presence, and asking me why I'm so serious all the time but I just don't even know how to react with them any more

I'm not like this with any other of my friendship groups, I am known to be a laid back fun guy and I always have an awesome time with them - but this friendship group at uni makes me so depressed sometimes I don't know if I can handle another 3 years with them around.

To get to the point, I got my clothes together for laundry today, and after looking around for something clean to wear for the day, I came across the shirt and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried it on in the mirror, and lo and behold, it fit! It fucking fit! I'm not usually very emotional, but I just couldn't stop thinking about trying so many times (and failing) to lose weight in middle school. How convinced I was that I'd never be able to wear something that small, and that it was nothing but a keepsake. It felt so good y'know?

I have taken some drugs before, but you know, I think about the future with her. Accepting hard drug user is not for me.

Basically he broke up with me after a year, out of the blue, because of personal problems. Things were pretty shit for ages but we never really, properly broke up.
We quickly started sleeping together again not long after we 'broke up' but we were closer to a relationship than fuck buddies.

We have been going on/off for about 5 months now. The thing is he refuses to be in a relationship with me simply because 'he doesn't want to be in a relationship'. He won't explain why and leaves or we get into a big argument every time I bring it up.

I know that I could keep going along in this 'not relationship' but it really messes with my head the fact that he won't commit to a relationship and he has no reason  other than 'he can't' (We have agreed to being exclusive and I believe him 100%)

I don't know what to do a this point because it seems he would rather cut off everything (we usually talk/text every day) than to be in a relationship, but we've been through so much and I've been so hurt so many times that it just seems too unfair that it's going to just end.

Am I within my legal right to pursue a vendor contract or is this illegal to pursue?

Say another Vendor2 terminates supply agreement with ClothingStore5,
if there is a rule that implies that I am barred from doing business with Vendors of ClothingStore5, am I allowed to pursue Vendor2 since they are no longer a vendor?

This caused us to break up for a week or so, however I caved because I missed her incredibly hard so we got back together. I had to leave home from Uni and expected her to arrive to my home for NYE, which she did. We had an amazing week that really strengthened our relationship, however she confessed to me that she had cheated on me, yet again, in the interval between us getting back together and her arriving to my home. This made me terribly angry but we still remained together mostly because she kept telling me that she's over it and now she is completely happy with me. She still is friends with at least one of those guys, despite me asking her to sever those ties for my sake.

I feel extremely conflicted about this in more than one way. Due to being cheated on twice, this has made me extremely suspicious and paranoid (which feels really unhealty), although when I am with her things just feel right.

Basically, I feel like I am in love with her, but I don't really like her. I haven't heard anyone else go through anything similar, how common is this and how does one deal with it?

Right now I am considering breaking up with her this weekend - for good - but I keep going from anger to anxiousness, fear, love etc. a really confusing cocktail of emotions... And it's distracting me from my work and life.

461, I told my friend if I didn't ask out a girl by the end of school that he could kick me in the balls. He knees me in the balls and tells her what I was planning to do to her. Which then I had to tell,"So this happened about an hour ago. But first let me explain what lead to this FU. For the whole week I've been trying to ask out a girl, we will call her P. But I wasn't able to gain the confidence. So my solution was to tell a friend if I didn't ask out P by the end of the day that he could kick me in right in the balls. See I was in a rush and meant to tell him ""If I don't ask P out by the time I leave the school, kick me in the balls"" but instead I said ""If I don't ask P out by the time school is over, kick me in the balls"" this wouldn't be an issue if I planned to ask her out before the end of school, nope I planned the ask her out while everyone was leaving the school because school was over. 

I walked up to her then my friend walks up to me ""Did you ask her out yet?"" I say no and without anytime to realize what's happening he knees me right in the balls which I then fell over yelling in agony. Which to then he tells her what I was planning to do in my horror. Which then I explained to him what I originally meant to say. I then was too embarrassed to ask her out and left the school in extreme pain.

462," Boyfriend makes date plans with me, but then makes plans with friends/family, which ends up cutting our date short, it's just starting to get highly inconsiderate. Is it wrong for me to be miffed about this?? He","So my bf and I have been together for a year and half now. We're kinda of long distance, but not by much...he lives an hour away from my city, and we see each other once or twice a week [usually tuesdays & wednesdays b/c those are his days off work]. 

Anyways, last Tuesday he drove down to my city for our movie and dinner date, and the next day [Wednesday] we had made plans for me to come over to his place, and we would just relax and stay in. 

Tuesday date was great, however he had to leave our dinner early [at 8pm] because he was meeting his brother later that night. Wednesday, he cancelled because he needed more time to get his errands done, so I told him that it was fine, and I would just come over next week, because I understand that was his only day off to do all his errands, so no worries, I was ok with that. He apologized and reassured me that next week we would definitely see each other twice.  

So the plan this week is, that Tuesday I will go over to his place...and he informs me that our date has to be cut short, because he made plans with his older brother to watch a basketball game with him...so that means I will only get to see him for about 4 or 5 hours, and then he has to leave his place to go over to his brother's. And no mention about coming down to see me the next day [wednesday]? 

I understand if it's a once in a while thing, but this is like a reoccurring stunt now, he's done this in the past...always makes date plans with me, but then also makes plans with friends/family, which ends up cutting our date short, it's just starting to get highly inconsiderate.  I guess I just want to know if I'm right to be miffed about this?? He is a popular guy with tons of friends and family, but I just wish I could at least have him for 1 day all to myself, is this wrong?

463," I met a guy and hooked up with him, now he's ignoring me and sending short messages. Is he just a jerk or is he playing games with me? I'm confused as to his behavior and I don't know what to think.","So this guy ""friend"" and I have had a thing (crush) for each other for some time. A couple months ago we got drunk and ended up hooking up. Since then, we have hooked up a few times. I'm not expecting anything serious to come of this but I am a little confused as to his behavior and actions.

Prior to the hookup, we would talk and text fairly often. We get along very well and were pretty friendly.  Now, it seems as though he is actively ignoring my texts. He delays responses and sends very short messages. No real conversations. 

Now, I'm quite aware many men are just after sex, and if that were the case I really wouldn't mind but some of his other behavior throws me off. He's introduced me to all of his brothers and his mom. He's introduced me to his best female and male friends. 

When we are together he acts like his normal self, but then I'll hardly hear from him during the week. He also told me in person that he's into me and that the first time he spoke to me he was so nervous he was shaking.

So my question is, is this guy just a jerk that got what he wanted or is he playing games with me?
I'm very easy going - I'd be open for just a casual relationship, something more or simply a friendship. I'm just really getting mixed messages here and I don't know what to think.

465, I want to buy an aircraft carrier and hire a crew to run it as a private military company (PMC) and hire out its military resources to other countries (or even hire it out to other PMCs). Is it possible in the real world,"Ok, first of all I understand this is an entirely impossible situation. I am obviously not looking into fielding my own army, but I'm wondering how feasible it would be in some alternate world where money is no object.

I started thinking about this when I read [this] article on a Royal Navy aircraft carrier ""going up for sale"". I thought to myself ""Heh, it would be pretty cool to have your own fully functional aircraft carrier."" (Yes, I understand it's not being sold for further military use.) 

This lead me to expand the scenario in my head; ""What if (assuming I'd won the lottery, invested it awesomely and had more money than god) I bought the aircraft carrier and bought all the equipment/aircraft for it and hired personnel to run it!"" At this point I'm floating on my own self-delusional fantasy of sailing the seven seas and exploring the world in my own aircraft carrier like some kind of Captain Nemo.

After that little ego indulgence, I took the thought experiment further. Can you legally own and use private military equipment and subsequently hire the necessary personnel? (Mercenaries?) I'm guessing you'd need a permit, but when you're in a ship that can cross international sea-borders it gets a bit more complicated. And then what if you wanted to hire out your military resources, say deploy aircraft/marines from the ship to fight in some civil war? I'm guessing that would have wider international repurcussions as you could be convicted of war crimes.

If that's the case, then how do Private Military Corporations (""PMCs"", made famous by game franchise Mercenaries) get about it? I did a little light reading (i.e. read the wiki article) on them and I see the majority of their work comes from actual governments, but they can't be their only clients? (Yes, I also understand that there aren't hordes of evil mega-corps with private armies waging war across the world unlike what most video-games portray.)

Overall I just thought this was an interesting little piece of speculation and thought I'd ask for people's opinions!

466," I got a 2000 Avalon, dealership changed the drain plug, now the oil is leaking. Merchants wont remove it because of liability reasons, and the dealer might mess up the pan, and cost hundreds of dollars. What is the best course of action here","Background: I am in a good financial situation. I am 22. 2 months ago I bought a car from a dealer. A 2000 Avalon. We agreed on a price before they knew that I earned 58k a year. I think they assumed that I had a rich dad or something. I got a good deal. The dealership, during the credit check, found out my financials, and pushed HARD for a more expensive vehicle, pulling out all tricks out of the book to insure I would not get the 2000 Avalon. I got the car anyway, after calling the dealership out on a bunch of bullshit. They fully checked the vehicle, and changed oil, tires, timing belt, etc. I got a warranty for 1k miles.

Fast forward 2 months. Getting an oil change because I put 3k miles on the vehicle. Merchants(national auto services chain) tells me that the dealership must have changed the drain plug, and that its leaking. They wont remove it for liability reasons, ask me to call the dealer. They use the term ""piggybacked"". I know nothing about cars, so this is all jibberish to me. Merchants tells me that if they remove the drain plug, they might mess up the pan, and that would cost hundreds of dollars.

My instinct tells me the dealership knew exactly what they are doing, and are being douchebags.

So my question: What is the best course of action here? I could call the dealer, and tell them that if they dont fix it, I will post a bad review on every website I can find, and not reccomend them to my friends. To the mechanics of reddit: what are your thoughts?

Is there a better way to handle the","I just wanted to get some second opinions on the course of action I just took. I went out with my friends tonight (all male), however after this was planned my female friend (23/f) began attempting to rally myself and the guys I was with into meeting her for company at the local bar. I brought this up, but nobody was particularly interested, which was fine with me.

It came to the end of the night (around 12:30am) and I texted the female friend saying that I'm sorry but we just finished up. I'd just dropped my friends home so I was on my own. She then pushed for me to come join her at a bar to watch a sports game and have drinks.

This girl I've known for over a decade, and I consider her my best friend. However, I couldn't help but feel how this may be seen in the eyes of my SO of 1.5 years (24/F) - I know that if she went out with a male friend, alone, likely drinking, this late into the night that I'd be concerned.

Hence I made the call to just go home and said that I was tired to my friend. Although I feel like I'm doing right by my SO for sure, I worry that it's coming at the cost of doing things with my friend that there would be no issue with if my friend were a guy. Don't get me wrong, I feel happy about my decision and would have been uneasy with the alternative, however - is my emotional position correct? Should I feel the need to avoid such situations, or should I refuse to compromise a friendship due to the gender the friend may have?

He's my best friend, and I love him to death","So Reddit, I'm getting kind of desperate. I love my father very much, and I'm starting to get horribly worried about him. 

He works twelve hour days on average, being the manager at an office supplies store. There have been times when he worked forty hours in *three days*. He hardly eats at work, since he's so completely busy and understaffed. (His company won't let him hire more employees) He's lost around twenty-thirty pounds since he only ever eats dinner. In general, his company and his employee's are screwing him over. Whenever one of his employee's skips out on my father, my dad has to step in. And he can't do anything about it. We can't afford for him to quit his job of ten years right now either.

The worst part is that he's seemed to turn to alcohol and cigarettes to help cope. On average he drinks six-eight beers a night, and I have no idea how many cigarettes he smokes on average since he does it in secret even though he knows I know. He refuses to go to the doctor either, so I have no idea how much this affects him. This has been going on for about 2-4 years now.

I've tried confronting him about his problem two or three times, and sometimes he promises he'll stop, and other times he's simply annoyed at me. I'm terrified it's affecting his health- I would never be able to forgive myself if something happened to him because I was too scared to speak up. I'll be honest here, I have a history of depression. As I am right now, I don't think I would be able to live without my father.

469, I want my boyfriend to meet my parents and have dinner with them. He says he doesn't like doing that stuff and it's not important to me. He says he just doesn't like doing that kind of stuff. What the fuck...,"We've been dating a year and have yet to have dinner with my family. It's just my parents and I, and this Easter we were supposed to go visit his family, who I've spent multiple weekends with despite them living a 3 hour drive away. We ended up not going as we didn't want to make the drive and then drive back the next day to see my parents. I was so excited when he finally seemed okay with meeting them and having dinner. 

Yesterday and now today (Easter) he's been lazy all day, wanting to sit around and not leave the house and I asked if we could do something. Then he was rude and said ""you're already making me do something I hate by going to dinner with your parents."" He said he hates mindless small talk (I said if he built a relationship with them it wouldn't be small talk) and I also asked if he's met his ex's parents and he said ""yes but I didn't see them that often."" Which I replied once in a year is not often. 

I've told him this is really important to me and he says our relationship is serous. He also says he just ""doesn't like doing that kind of stuff."" And there's nothing more stopping him. Isn't this fucking ridiculous or?.... To me if you care about someone and date them then this is part of the deal??? You just get it over with. 

He didn't meet my parents until about 5 months into the relationship when we accidentally ran into them at a restaurant. They're very nice to him and are nice to all my past boyfriends - they even consider them family and try to have relationships with them all. Since that time we have stopped by their home for about 3 minutes to borrow something twice.

What can I do to make things better for us?","I apologize in advance for the long winded nature of this. There are several issues and stressors involved. My husband and I have been married 3 1/2 years. We both work full-time. He has a band he does gigs with almost 3 days a week. He cares for his elderly grandmother, and his father is extremely sick - to the point of discussing end of life care. We have custody of his 12 year old son from his first relationship.

I have been taking care of everything at the home: cleaning, paying bills, calling repairmen, parenting. I am getting extremely tired. I love my husband, and am trying to be very understanding. Our sex life has dwindled. He drinks and smokes excessively, and I have tried to have conversations with him about this to no avail. He cracks a beer when he gets home from work and drinks until he comes to bed at midnight. Now don't get me wrong, I like a few drinks, but this is escapism. I know it has to be due with his stress level. He is on Facebook scheduling gigs and talking with musicians all day. When he gets home, he either sits in the basement on the PC or has the tablet on him at all times. I can hardly hold a conversation with him. I feel ignored. The lack of attention and the fact that he is tipsy every night (and smells like smoke) make the idea of sex unattractive. He is a good lover, and when we have sex it is amazing. 

The stress of parenting our step-son is a problem as well, and I know that affects both of us. 

I attempted to have a calm discussion with him last night, and he told me 'Man, I hope you start your period soon.' This is not constructive!  How can I re-connect? I want our marriage to work. Has anyone else been through this with a partner? Is this a phase that will pass as things in our life calm down?

Travelling up through Slovenia, Austria, Germany(maybe Munich stop over for a couple days, no idea) and ending in Zurich, Switzerland. I have no idea about what I should see or if I should stay a bit in Slovenia, or Austria or even Germany or Switzerland. 

I would be free for an March/April trip.

I have a history of shutting down during arguments with him, and I'm unsure if I'm committing some kind of conflict resolution crime. 

It happens for different reasons. Sometimes I get really angry, and worry about saying something I will regret, and so I walk away until I can calm down. Other times, he will be yelling at me and saying irrational things - in this case, I will tell him we aren't in any emotional state to be solving problems, and we should take a break until we calm down. A third kind of silence is where I am just thinking, and trying to sort out my feelings and decide what I want to say. After about a minute of my not saying anything, he will usually get angry and make a snide comment about how I have stopped talking and refuse to engage in problem solving with him, in which case I will usually yell, ""I'm thinking!!"" 

We always eventually come back to the conflict and resolve it. Usually, later that day, or at most within a day or two, I will bring it back up once we have calmed down, and we will talk rationally about it and it will get resolved... or at least we will reach a place of love and understanding where we acknowledge that we have disagreement, but still love and respect each other, even if the issue isn't going to be resolved right now. 

I've heard that ""stonewalling"" is a sign of a troubled marriage. I am committed to changing my behavior if it is destructive, and he is too. Does what I described sound like stonewalling? 

As a separate matter, is it destructive to walk away in order to calm down? Or to take time to sort out your thoughts before talking? I have told him that this is why I sometimes have to walk away from a fight - he knows that it isn't lack of commitment to work on a problem. It really, really bothers him, though, when I have to take a break. Should I just stick it out and keep arguing?

479," I met a girl, we became friends, but eventually, we fought and broke up. Even after that, I still miss her, but why? I have other friends, but why do I miss her so much, even though we can't talk","So, I don't know what my problem is.
I go to college, in my final year. I met this girl who was really awesome. Eventually, I had feelings for her, but she rejected me and we stayed friends. Though, it didn't work out, because we would always fight (we had no communcation for a total of three times until we finally quit being friends forever) through both of our ignorance. It was my fault I couldn't control my feelings, but sometimes she would just be such an asshole (which is why I called the friendship quits forever.)
But even through that, she was an amazing friend. She used to care for me a lot, and vice verce. For some reason, I am always bothered by the fact I miss her, even though I shouldn't.
My issue is that, I have other friends, I talk to a lot of people at my uni, but for some reason, I still miss her? Even though we can't talk anymore because our friendship is beyond repair, I just don't get it. I just feel alone without her. But why? After what she done to me, I should forget her, but I can't?
Why is this happening?

480, Friend is dating a guy who is emotionally abusive and has a history of being emotionally abusive.  She has come to me for advice on how to handle the situation.  What can I do to remove myself from the situation and how can I handle the,"Reddit, I come to you for advice.  Below is a cliff notes version of a long complicated story: 

Essentially my best friend of 15 years (and roommate) tends to find herself in toxic emotionally abusive relationships as a result (I believe) of extremely low self-esteem and need to ""fix"" people.  She is EXTREMELY sensitive, to the point of avoiding any and all conflict.  The most recent man she has dated has an unstable personality and has extreme jealously issues, inability to cope when she is out of town without resorting to destructive behaviors, and relays a lot of guilt to her when she isn't with him.  

She has come to me several times venting hurt and frustrations with this situation and seeking advice.  My mom works with victims of domestic abuse and ended up talking to her for a long time on signs of emotional abuse.  She seemed receptive.  This conversation led to what we were hoping for was a breakup, as she realized she needs some professional council herself.  It turns out it was more of a quasi break up with ""not wanting to hurt his feelings"" and ""I can't quit people"" excuses.  They are essentially still together.

I'm frustrated and exhausted from this situation.  She is an adult and will make her own decisions whether they are destructive or not.  I'm hurting because I hate watching this unfold, and know I am powerless. 

What I need some advice on is how can I remove myself from this situation.  What do I say/do when/if she comes to me?  When he comes over to hang out? I get angry when I see him.  Any honest advice is appreciated.

481," I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years and I'm not sure if it's better to meet new people now or wait a few months to truly get some closure on this relationship first. If getting back into dating makes sense to you, how does","My girlfriend and I just broke up about a month ago. She was my one and only (we started dating when I was 16, we were each other's first/only sexual partner). Though our breakup was amicable and respectful, we had irreconcilable differences (issues with sexual compatibility, career choices, weight problems, me wanting to live in a big city whereas she didn't, etc).

I have no desire to try to get back to her because I know we have to be with different people in order to grow (maybe potentially get back together one day). 

It is painful that nothing really wrong happened in our relationship (no trust issues, infidelity, abuse, lies or anything of the sort) and we just grew apart and eventually fell out of love. We are still friends though we don't talk so much to avoid feeling sad.

In your opinion: is it better to try to meet new people now or wait a few months to truly get some closure on this relationship first? If getting back into dating makes sense to you, how does that even start when you're coming out of such a LTR? I've never picked up a girl in my life, our relationship grew from a friendship and even then we were still teenagers so it was a different game altogether. If you're a woman, how would you feel if I told you about this very significant relationship that just ended? 
It sucks being alone, I miss the companionship, the partnership and the sex and if nothing else I just wanted to vent here.

483, I blew my nose on my girlfriends face whilst mid kiss with her and my friend was passing by and said something that made me laugh so hard that I blew my nose all over her face. It was a long time ago and we still laugh about it,"This didn't happen today, it actually happened a few years ago whilst I was in Year 11 (UK here). I'd recently started dating a girl and she was very shy, had a lot of problems as a child but I was there to support her and it's definitely worth it. She was the kind that didn't really talk to me during lessons and in person but would always text me outside of school.

 A bit of back story to the situation, I have this friend who is very 'random' (not the kind of HUUR HUUR SO RANDUM XDDDDD!!11) But the kind that does outrageous shit and nobody ever expects it. He got into a lot of trouble doing this kind of stuff and didn't even finish the year because he was excluded before the year had even ended.

Anyway, there I was during the lunchbreak with my girlfriend and I had a terrible cold. I was constantly sniffling and sneezing and I managed to hold off from any disasters until this event. Me and my girlfriend were mid kiss and I can't remember exactly what my friend had said but I heard him say something whilst he was walking past me, I wish I could remember because I found it hilarious and couldn't contain my laughter. As I was midway through kissing I couldn't laugh, this meant that I had blown my nose out of its contents which ultimately ended up all over my girlfriends face. 
I apologized profusely and was extremely embarrassed, Luckily for me she wasn't too grossed out and we still laugh about it 4 years on.

488," Mom is deaf, doesn't like when I tell people she is deaf when they ask questions. What can I do to make her feel better about it and make it easier for her to communicate with people who don't know she is deaf?","My mom is deaf. 

I don't see her very often, almost none over the past few years except major holidays, but I have seen her a couple times this year and usually we go out and do stuff. This usually requires her to interact with strangers who don't know she's deaf, usually cashiers and people who attempt to spark up conversations. I used to only be around her in public when I was younger and she would do the communicating.

Now that I am older, I feel obligated to do the talking because most people just get confused from her. 

Here are some of the options that we've tried:

* Her writing a note and handing it to the other person.  This used to work well, but now it is taken as a robbery thing at a lot of places and she can't do that anymore.

* Her trying to speak out the words. This usually doesn't work because she is very hard to understand by someone who is not used to it.

* What I have been doing lately is speaking for her. Usually I know her intent and when she is spoken to, I but in and answer for her. 
Like ""Do you want a receipt?"" I know she always does so I say yes, even if they are looking at her and I'm a few steps away.  A lot of people tend to take this as really rude and that I'm some 'wife abuser' type (My mom looks half her age)

If the person has to ask a lot, I tell them that she is deaf and they will then speak to me, but in many situations, there is no talking and it isn't necessary to say it. The cashier might make small comments like ""Oh this food taste good"" or ""Pretty dress"" not requiring a response, but then they will ask a question and I feel odd for not telling them right off the bat that she is deaf and heard nothing that they said for the past 5 minutes.

We got together in November of our first year and he suggested living together this year. I had some doubts as I was worried that he would miss out on living with his guy friends, but he said he really wanted to live with me because he loved me etc.
Fast forward and we've now been living together 2 weeks. He started being really distant with me almost as soon as we moved in, and after 3 days announced that next year (3rd year of university) he was going to move in with his guy friends. I was pretty upset as I thought I must have done something wrong for him to decide after only 3 days that he didn't want to live with me, and also because I was now going to have to live with him for the rest of the year, whilst knowing that he didn't really want to be here.
He's still being really off with me and told me the other night (when he was drunk) that he feels really trapped in the relationship, but that he doesn't want to break up. Whenever I've tried to ask him about he flat out refuses to talk about it. This is a bit of a recurring theme, whenever we have problems he just refuses to talk about them and makes out that I'm ""making a big deal about it"".
I don't know what to do about it, I feel like he's really down about living with me, but he won't talk about it. Neither of us can afford to change our living arrangements this year as we signed a contract for our current house for the whole of this year. I love him, but I don't love the way he's treating me at the moment.

It all first started on halloween last year. We kinda didnt know each other too well but i really enjoyed being around him, he was really kind and sweet but now it's just not really the same. 

Whenever we went out i always had a really good time and everything was enjoyable but we really don't do that anymore. he keeps wanting to buy things for me, pay for things for me, honestly do anything. he wants to change his entire lifestyle for me and i'm not really liking the idea of that. before i met him i was planning to move out of town with some friends and he brought on the idea that he wants to move out with me and again... not really cool with that idea. 

Im just scared at this point because i feel like if i leave his life is going to get wrecked... he's not really financially stable and not very smart with his money and he moved out of his parents already. he doesnt have a vehicle and not a really reliable place to stay. ive tried being available to him and tried to help him as best i can but i just don't think its working. this relationship is causing me a lot of stress, and i don't know what to do and i don't know who i can talk to about it. 

like right now, i'm quite a few states away from him visiting my very sick grandfather who doesnt have much time left. he texts me as i'm on my way to the airport and that hes going to see a counselor. about what? i dont know. just as i get off the plane he tells me he flung his phone, shattering the screen and ended up breaking a pair of really nice sunglasses i got him. adding to the stress of probably losing my grandfather soon.

I've been having trouble with friends a bit lately, but found a lot of consolation in a girl I've known for two years now. We've been instant messaging a lot, and I even visited her home, which is quite rare for me to do with most people.

Although we didn't do much, and just talked about school and managing our lives, it was a very nice, open conversation, and it felt like a fresh breath of air. She's very dedicated to her education and career, so she's very helpful about school, and found it sort of a waste we didn't do anything about it (I'm already ahead with most subjects, since I have to redo the year).

I had already contemplated pursuing her because I was in love with her personality and demeanor, but when she got a little tired and laid on the bed and sort of curled up, she looked incredibly cute. So then the physical attraction was there, too.

The only problem I can really think of is that's she's 19, nearing 20, and I'm 16, nearing 17. That makes me just as old as her oldest little brother. So I'm still insecure about pursuing beyond friends. While I am sort of half busy with high school, she's busy getting a internship for her study, so time together will be little, and she's very serious about stuff like that, so she's not online much either. That's gonna be like that for at least a month, she estimates.

I really could use a relationship with a girl like her, and she's my most viable option (sorry if I sound calculating/distant/not romantic here, it's how I say things related to romances, mainly starting them). Since I'm losing friends, more or less, I also could use the mental and emotional warmth a relationship would bring.

499," Wife doesn't want me working extra hours to make money to pay bills, but doesn't want me spending time with her when we have free time. What do I do?
TL;DR: Wife doesn't want me working extra hours to make","My wife and I have been married a year and a half, known each other for 3 and a half.

We live in our own home and both work full time jobs - me 7-4 and her 7-3, Monday - Friday.

Recently her student loan bills have started coming in (just graduated) and we are barely making our monthly bills. I do some freelance writing on the side and can make a decent amount of money working just 1-2 hours a day extra.

The problem is that she always wants me to spend time with her. As an example, this past weekend we went camping on Friday right after work. We stayed and hung out with her friends until Saturday at 2pm. We went home until 8, and hung out until 11 at a bar.

Today, Sunday, I'm trying to do some work and she is hassling me because ""I don't ever spend time with her"". Her stepfather used to always ignore her while working on the computer, and I think she has a very negative view of what I'm doing because of it.

Basically, I feel a great conflict and don't know what to do. On one hand, we really need the money and she realizes this (she's actually the one that likes to spend money and wants to go out, make improvements to the house). On the other hand, she doesn't want me working extra to achieve this.

500, I want to get my new nurse a little something to make her night shift a little easier on her.  What can I get her that will make her life easier at work and maybe make her more happy in general?,"A little back story.  When she went to school for nursing, she had her heart set on the ER.  She was even promised a job at the ER before she graduated.  Two weeks before graduation they filled the position she was supposed to take. Then, it took her a few months to find a job.

She finally took a job at a cancer unit where she was on the terminal floor.  She had a hard time there.  She would build report with her patients and they would die one after another.  Working there changed her a lot.  She grew up quick... too quick.  

Anyway, she is transferring to the ER in the next few weeks.  She has to work the night shift though.  It's more money, but that means her schedule is going to fucked.  What could I get her to make working night shifts a little easier on her?

I'm in a weird spot because I don't want to be in the same room as him but I think it would be weird if I didn't attend this funeral, since the funeral is for my gf's sister who recently passed unexpectedly.

Super sexy, actress/model/whatevers. 
I have done this many times, including entering only a girls first name into FB counting on the algorithm utilizing location and the chance we have at least one friend in common.

506, I have a new boyfriend who takes my phone and reads my texts. He doesn't see it as a big deal and doesn't understand why I don't want him to do it. He doesn't take it seriously when I tell him to stop.,"I just recently started dating a new guy. We have been talking/in a exclusive sexual relationship since the summer. We finally made it official (as in we would begin to introduce ourselves as bf and gf) a few weeks ago. 

He's awesome. I like him a lot. We have great chemistry and are really happy. I just absolutely HATE that he takes my phone from me! If I get up to go to the bathroom, or leave my phone unoccupied and in his line of sight, he just starts to go through it. He reads my texts to other people when I'm not around. He looks over my shoulder when I'm texting my friends. If someone texts me, he will ask who it is and want to see. It's not as if he does it sneakily or tries to hide it. He will reference what another person had said to me, which he has no way of knowing without reading our conversation.

I guess he just is curious and thinks its funny. Or wants to know what I say about him to my girlfriends. Regardless, it's more than annoying. It's gotten to the point where I'll just leave my phone in my car or hide it in his room when we hang out. I like being accessible and able to talk to people, but he makes it impossible unless he is being included.

I've told him to stop many times. I've told him he is being creepy. I take my phone away when I see him with it. I don't have anything to hide, but it would still be nice to have some privacy. He just tells me its not a big deal, he gets bored and my conversations are interesting. And that I can go through his phone if I want. But I really have no desire to??

He has continued to talk to her behind my back, and I don't know whether to stay with him or not.","First of all, I got out of a very toxic relationship 8 months ago. My ex cheated on me and I swore I would never date a liar again. 2 months ago I met my boyfriend and everything was going great. He told me he talked with one of his exes very often, but he hadn't talked to her in a couple of months. I told him about my last boyfriend and that this situation made me very uncomfortable. He assured me that he only had eyes for me. 2 nights ago he left his phone at my place. I was pretty drunk and decided to take a look at his whatsapp messages (really bad on my part, I know, but it's done now) and found out they had been speaking very frequently (they were sexting one week before we met) AND on top of this, he was telling her EVERYTHING we did (sex included). Also, he's very fond of her (they have known each other for years). 

In short, he lied to me, knowing that I really hate liars. He's usually very open with me, showing me the password for his phone and everything, so this was a shock to me. Now I feel like I can't trust him at all. It really hurts because everything was going really really well, I was starting to fall for him. Now I have no idea of what to do. It's very unlikely that they will have sex or go out together, since she lives across the ocean, but of course he can cheat in other ways. We went out yesterday and I acted all normal because I didn't know what to say, but I'm going to confront him tomorrow. The problem is, I don't know whether I should break up with him. Should I give him a second chance if he says he's going to cut off all contact with her? How can I ever trust him again?

Somewhat reluctantly, the broker told me that I would technically be able to invest in (nearly) any fund offered by Franklin Templeton, but that expenses help pay for his salary because my company (a small non-profit) does not pay a fee for his services, and that he believes people get too wrapped up in thinking expense ratios are the most important thing.

I have read many times that a managed fund is unlikely to beat the market, and that I should try to invest in a low cost ETF or similar, because fees and compound interest mean significantly less income over the life of an investment. 

I'm tempted to tell the broker ""I'm sorry it would cut into your salary, but it cuts into my income more"", but I'm worried about it hurting the relationship between the broker and my company, and it *is* true that fees helped pay for the rather lengthy phone call I made to him in the first place!

I'm also curious why he chose to purchase FTGTX when FGTIX seems to be the same fund, except Class A. Couldn't he have purchased FGTIX? They both seem to have the same minimum investment. Did he choose the C Class fund only because Franklin Templeton gives him a bigger cut, or are there other reasons he might have chosen it?

We've just nailed down the date to next June (yay!) and found this incredible location in a park that does weddings for FREE! Knocked my socks off. Money is tight so free is kind of amazing. Especially for two days so we can set up on Friday and come back on Saturday. We were going to have it at home so this relieves a lot of financial and other stress (there's a lot of work to do on our new house).

The only issue is, I don't want a dry wedding. I don't need a crazy party wedding either, and no one I'm inviting typically acts a fool unless it's the right time and place. This place doesn't allow alcohol but I've been to two weddings in alcohol-free locations where folks just quietly enjoyed beers or a covert cocktail. No one was beligerant and no one stopped them.

We'll have the wedding a bit earlier in the day than we'd planned (when we planned to have it at home the ceremony was going to be later to avoid the heat, like 6:30 or 7, but here we'll probably shoot for 4 or 5, ending by 8) so I'm hopeful that folks can stand not getting too toasty until the afterparty.

My thought was a tasteful, not strong lemonade cocktail already mixed along with other non-boozy drinks for kids. Maybe some wine. This just happened today so the logistics are fuzzy.

We'll go out after or have a party at home so we can get crazier then, but we all drink lightly so I'd like to avoid going dry. Please try to understand (and please be gentle) I'm not trying to disrespect the park - because we'd be diligent about cleanup and breakdown and super-respectful of the facilities, I can't see the harm in a drink on my wedding day to take the edge off.

I was recently away for a week followed by 3 days of him insisting he couldn't see me because of preparing for interviews and during those 10 days, he called me once. I called him once as well. He may have also texted me once, and I tried him a few times. I'd say about half the days there was nothing. 

I don't want to talk all day but I feel like wanting a few texts a day or a call occasionally or even those IMs back would be nice. I don't want to seem clingy though because when he does have a period free from work, he spends a lot of time with me and I do genuinely think he is happy.

I asked him why he hadn't filed for divorce and he said it was because he didn't want to upset her and ruin the relationship that he had worked really hard to attain for the sake of the girls. She can't take him for any money or assets etc as the laws here won't allow for it in his situation and they already split everything when they separated. 

Neither of us are interested in getting married ever but I still don't know how I feel about him still being married to her. I haven't really brought it up with him again and am wondering if I should just accept it as is and move on with life. We have been dating for only 5 months.

522," I got ditched by a girl I really liked and I'm feeling a mix of sorrow and anger. I would love to hear tips on how to deal with the emotions that are coming up right now, and how to cope with the fact that I","So I just got ditched by this girl. Even before I met her I was known as a very serious and cynical person (somewhat because of previous experiences with relationships, but also due to depressions and a very misantrophic worldview).

So this happened an hour ago. I've been in this situation many times before and for all experience I've attained, I know the best thing to do is to try to do things that just make one happy and lets the thoughts wonder away. Problem being I normally - even prior to this relationship and break up - don't have things that make me happy, save for drug use and the company of friends. 

I've struggled with the fact that I don't find *anything* interesting or funny for quite some years, so just go out and do stuff with my friends that I normally enjoy isn't an option for me. To make things even more difficult, the few friends I have are normally some distance away for me, and neither of my friends really know how to deal with me under my 'normal' episodes.

As you can imagine, I'm feeling a mix of extreme sorrow and anger right now. Aside from what processes I will initiate to try to cope with this (extreme lack of trust toward people in general and women in particular), I haven't been in this situation for quite some years and - and maybe this is the emotional trauma at the moment - I can't remember how I dealt with this storm of emotions in the immediate aftermath.
 
I'm 28 and I've dealt with multiple break-ups before, this one having potential to be especially hard as I worked *really* hard to open myself up and allowing myself to fall in love again. I've always had a  
hard time post break-ups. I would love to smoke some weed to take my mind off of things, but have no access to it at the moment. (And there's no problem of hard drug abuse and I'm very controlled as to self-destructiveness, so if it's on anyone's mind, no need to worry about falling to a heroine addiction or something similar) 

Any tips and ideas on what to do to deal with this immediate outburst of emotions are appreciated.

TL;DR: I hung out with my","I grew up with a girl who went to the same church as me, and we were friends who hung out quite a bit until the end of high school and college.  She had gone to school quite a distance from me, so we didn't see each other again until she finished college.   When she got back, we started hanging out again, and really hit it off, but at the time, I was still really hurting over my ex, and didn't want a relationship.  She tried to kiss me, but I turned my cheek (I know, really low). I really liked her, I just didn't want to put her through me being unsure all the time (I was still in love with my ex).  We kept hanging out, and I invited my best friend to hang out with us.  They became friends and started to hang out occasionally.

Fast forward a while.  Her and my best friend, who work and live fairly close together, decide to move in together for financial reasons and because it would be fun to live with a friend.  He had a GF at the time so I wasn't too worried.  He ended up breaking up with his GF, and dating my childhood friend once they moved in, and have now lived together for a year.

Now, I'm constantly jealous, and regret my choices every single day.  I'm assuming I should probably just shut up and deal with it, but they are two of my closest friends.  How do I deal with hanging out with them, especially with all the PDA.

525," Brother and wife got back together, eloped, and announced they were having a child. The due date is March 15th, but the wife said she was conceived on July 23rd. How can I tell my brother when the child was conceived,","My brother just got married a couple weeks ago. He eloped with his now wife, and it was a surprise to almost everyone. It was shocking to me because they had been broken up from mid may to late July. They got back together, quickly eloped, and then announced that they were pregnant. 

The whole situation made more sense after we found out she was pregnant. We figured they found out she was pregnant and wanted to do it the ""right way."" The only issue is, unless my fiancee and I have done the math wrong, there doesn't seem to be a way for the baby to be his. The due date is March 15th. If you count back 38 to 40 weeks, that puts conception in mid to late June. His wife told my fiancee that she knew her conception date was July 23rd. That would put her due date an entire month later at April 15th. 

My question is, how do I deal with this? If the wife isn't carrying my brother's child, he would most definitely want to know. There's also the possibility they were still hooking up during their breakup and it is his child. I want to make sure he knows when the baby was conceived, but if it's definitely his, I don't want to start unnecessary \ family drama. How can I approach this with him?

I work for a builder who builds houses in several subdivisions, each one having a ""sales center"" or example home really. My job is to show off these homes, which means I sit alone at an empty house and when people walk in I show them around and try to get them interested.

The fuckup starts with me entering the house as usual. One of the few useful appliances actually in the house is a small minifridge in the kitchen, which I usually keep sodas that I brought from home in. I hadn't consumed all of the sodas from the previous day, and upon opening the fridge I noticed a can of sprite was alarmingly deformed. The bottom and top were bulged so much that the can was a uniform pill shape. I noticed several water bottles in the fridge were also frozen. I immediately grabbed the can to go throw it away.

As I was walking towards the trash can, I happened to glance down at the top of the can. My eyes involuntarily shut and I heard a giant ""POW!"" sound, followed by the sprinkle of thousands of pressurized sprite droplets raining down (and up) upon the entire room. 

After my brain figured out what happened, I screamed and stumbled to where I believed a sink was, knocking everything over in the process. Once I figured out that I actually still had eyes, I noticed the sprite can looked like one of those exploding cigars from old cartoons. My eyes still hurt so bad and are sensetive to light, so I can only keep one open at a time, and I'm trying to clean up the show house before anyone else from the company shows up.

Alex and I started chatting and after she split up with her previous gf (she's bi) we ended up getting together. 

The months that followed were some of the happiest of my recent life. We became really comfortable around each other and told each other everything. We went out to places. Great times.

There were two issues though, two issues that my mind blew out of proportion:

 1. Her Dad, her dad (tbh) was the laziest person I've ever met, he lives on benefits and spends his life doing nothing of use. He then is a dick to everyone around him including Alex, and at sometimes me. So I ended up despising him though I didn't want to say anything as Alex really cared about him.

2. Her mood swings, one day she'd be over the moon but the next she'd crash and be really down. I'd do a lot to try and cheer her up sometimes with success but often to no avail. This often stressed me out. (Stress is one of those things I manage awfully).

So from these two issues my mind came to the conclusion that it'd never work and it'd be pointless to continue. At this point she really loved me so when I told her this it broke her heart. 

She ended up getting back on her feet and we have remained good friends. She ended up getting back with her ex and her father and his partner decided I was scum of the earth. As of late I can't help but think what a massive cock up I made. I still love her and really miss our relationship.

The post seemed to indicate that she had cheated on me back in February. For reference, we broke up at the beginning of March and have a child together and we will be co-parenting so trust and communication are still very important to me. I asked her about it and she said it was her but that it wasn't true. She has a habit of embellishing and distorting facts in an attempt to preserve anonymity. She started to get upset and asked me why it mattered if we weren't together anymore. 

I feel that whether we're together or not, a possible betrayal of trust that occurred when we were still together does indeed matter and her defensiveness only seemed to further the likelihood of there being something that did happen.

This has been a theme between us. She has cheated on me at least 7 times that I know of over the course of our 9 year relationship. She is also emotionally abusive and highly deceitful. It's always difficult to tell where the truth is in all the lies. She also has major communication issues. For a while, when she was in a domestic abuse class, things seemed to improve. Upon finishing the class, however, the old habits came back rapidly and finally lead to us breaking up.

Lately, any attempt to talk with her about even the smallest of concerns quickly degenerates into a fight because of her unwillingness to talk. I have significant concerns about the possibility of her becoming emotionally abusive towards our daughter in the future. The continued lack of open, honest communication does nothing to assuage those concerns.

While we were dating over a period of several months, my ex made me afraid to say no to sex. He was generally pretty emotionally abusive-- name calling, manipulating, gaslighting, etc. But if I denied him for sex, he would get extremely aggressive extremely suddenly.... He'd go zero to one hundred screaming, breaking things, punching things, etc. He did not ever hit me, but he was so out of control that it was clearly within the realm of possibility if I resisted at the wrong time.

For the past 6 months I've been having some weird annoying symptoms. My body is too responsive to stress and my work has been hectic, so that's probably the reason for it all. It could also be all kinds of serious things, either life threatening or crippling, but that's highly unlikely.

I went to a specialist doctor 2 months ago and got prescribed a lot of check-ups. I intended to be finished with it all by the time the wedding comes. Most of the check-up results came back, and are OK. There's one check-up left, and I'll only get to do it a couple of weeks after the wedding. The disease it's meant to rule out seems to be the best fit for my symptoms. Again, it's highly unlikely, but if that's the culprit, I won't be fun to be around for the rest of my life.

If I am indeed sick, I don't want to put my fiance in such difficult circumstances. For many reasons, I think it would be better for her if we're not married formally if that happens. Of course, it's too late to postpone the wedding now, especially for such a silly reason.

I'm thinking of having the full ceremony with all the guests, just tweaking the formal/religious parts of the ceremony so that they ""don't count"". Then, after we get the results of the check-up, we'll sort out the formalities. However, this solution will also cause all sorts of unnecessary dramas, for a really silly issue, and I'm uncomfortable with it.

542," I was with a girl who lied to me constantly. She ended up cheating on me. I found out. I'm now alone, completely alone, no friends, nothing left. Only my 2 children whom I love dearly. I don't understand why","Hi all
I'm following-up on my post 7 months ago : 

So I was with the gorgeous girls for 5 months. We lived together. It was a nightmare. She  has been lying all the way long and she made me miserable, ending only last week when I found she was chatting online with a guy with very romantic words. She denied everything but I had it all on my smartphone.. Even when she saw the recording she would still lie to me. 

I have tried everything for her. I did not lie anymore. I stopped chatting with other women. We lived together. I was in love. (I still am). She took my time, my love, all my money, she manipulated me more than I have ever manipulated anyone. She criticized me constantly, so much that my view of myself - which was not very good - is now completely destroyed. 

So ultimately life is teaching me a hard lesson. When you lie at people, your lies come back to you stronger. 

This relationship was doomed from the very beginning. I have been an a-hole to other people. I get what I deserve. Now I am alone, completely alone, no friends, nothing left. Only my 2 children whom I love dearly. I don't understand why they love me, I'm such a bad person. 

Anyway. 

Don't lie. Don't lie to yourself. Don't lie to others. It just does not work. 47 years of lies, and I'm collapsing more each day.

Is there something to hide in the past with her and the","Throwin away because she knows my real account name. I should also mention that we are currently in a long distance relationship.
Two days ago we were watching a movie when I saw her pressing a ""delete conversation"" button on the Messenger mobile app. After a long talk, she told me that she does this all the time and that she could never hide anything from me. I also believe that she truly loves me right now (she gets paranoid about me sometimes), so she could be hiding something that happened in the beginning of our relationship.

 

A few months ago, there was a guy that was really into her and they would give rides to each other all the time since they live nearby. After the long talk, I asked her if she also deleted all the conversations with this guys, to which she said yes.
I honestly have no idea on what to think of this, to me deleting conversations means that you don't want anyone to see them. However, she says that it is really normal and most people do it. What I'm looking for here is to try and understand if this is a common procedure. I have never ever deleted a single conversation, do people usually do it? And why would they do it?

 

We've been together for a year and she has never done anything that would make me not trust on what she is saying. I know that right now the only thing I can do is trust her, but I just wanted to get other points of view whether deleting conversations specifically implies that there is something to hide or not. This is really disturbing me and our relationship has never been so much at stake like it is now.

It states that if a child is left there any time past 6:30 they will be charged a fee that must be paid no later than the next working day or the child may be suspended.

My boss has told me that I will not be paid by the daycare past 6:30 no matter what, and any late charges are my responsibility to get from the parents. If I write a time on my time card that is even a few minutes after 6:30 (like if a parent takes too long to leave) my boss will actually scribble it out and write 6:30.

Last week I got stuck with a child a full hour after closing time. I filled out the late fee paper and gave it to the unapologetic mom who just glanced at it and stuck it in her purse. The fee was 70 dollars, but I felt bad because I knew she is on on DSHS so I only charged her 50.

I am still waiting for my money and really don't expect the mom to be able to pay it. My boss never suspends the children because she doesn't want to lose the business. 

Is this late-fee policy legal? Should my work be required to pay me for time I am there? Should they be responsible for the collecting the late fee? Should I get paid overtime? What can I do?

I'm confused because I'm not clingy at all.","Long story short, I developed a friendship with a coworker. He had originally expressed interest in me, and while the interest was mutual, I wasn't in a position to act on anything. Although we both had feelings for each other [read: intense crushes] we were still able to maintain a relationship. We would text / talk / hang out often, simply as friends.  He was very respectful of my situation and never made any advances, although he wanted to.

Fast forward about a year – we no longer work together and end up going out, getting drunk, and sleeping together. We had a great night, but I know how **some**men (and women) are, so I asked him after the encounter if he wanted me to stop talking to him and he told me that he didn't. Since the encounter, he has been very distant (and I'm not clingy, at all).  He takes a couple days to respond to a text, sometimes I won't hear from him for a few days.  Yet, he also sends me texts at various times of the day/night/early morning telling me he misses me and is thinking about me, that I'm awesome/cute etc.

Did he legitimately use me or is he just playing games with me now because he had pursued me for so long originally? I'm a bit confused.  I'm not clingy at all and can separate sex/emotions very well. I value his friendship a lot but I'm not sure if I should just put him in the douche bag book and move on.

548, I have depression and gained a lot of weight after being diagnosed with cancer. I have a crush on a former coworker and I don't know how to talk to her about it. I need help.,"So, I know it's sad. A little bit of a backstory before I say I need help:

I've dealt with issues of depression (up and down) for 13 years now; and I've never been able to climb my way out. There are times where I am happy with myself and then a week later I can't seem to do anything right. I've been getting better about not feeling down about myself but being down about being lonely.

About four years ago I was diagnosed with Stage IV Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Luckily I am now 3 years cancer free; but I had to gain a lot of weight because of it. (When I was diagnosed I was less than 130lbs I'm 5'6. After my treatments I went up to 205lbs because of my depression and I didn't realize how much I had gained) I met a girl during that time but I was burned pretty bad. Sadly, online relationships are a horrible idea; but due to my condition and I hadn't met a girl in nearly a year during that time I figured it would help. 

Most of the relationships I got into ended up like that; I was either cheated on or left because of my own self-sabotage (depression, not in love with person). I currently have a crush on a former coworker who I hang out with a lot because of my friends; we all used to work together and I haven't told her how I feel for fear of her not being around because of me.

Since that time I've tried and tried to get help and ask advice from friends but I feel like I'm burdening them with the same questions or pathetic whining. I don't want to ask for help but I feel that if I don't; it's only going to get worse.

So what I'm asking is this: Those of who have been like this before, how I do turn this around to where I can feel good about myself and finally be able to talk to women and find someone.

549, Girlfriend only wears seat belt 75% of the time. She said she will not wear seat belt 100% of the time. Is there anything I can do about this or should I just accept this part of my girlfriend?,"I've been together with my girlfriend for 9 months.

Today my girlfriend and I were looking at an article online that discussed a seat belt recall. During our discussion about the article, I asked my girlfriend how often does she wear her seat belt when driving. To my shock, she said she only wears a seat belt about 75% of the time. 

That means 25% of the time she does not wear a seat belt. She said that 25% of the time she doesn't care/doesn't even cross her mind of the dangers of not wearing a seat belt. 

She said that her mother has been pressuring her to wear her seat belt 100% of the time since she was 16 years old. However, since 16, she has worn her seat belt sporatically and she said she has no intentions of ever increasing to wearing it 100% of the time. She said that my request for her to wear it 100% of the time will not be followed. 

This makes me a little sick to my stomach and nervous for her safety. I don't want her to get in minor crash and die because of no seat belt. I feel like every time she goes driving I will be anxiously awaiting her to text me that she has arrived.

She is amazing, but I cannot do that.","First the good part - we have a wonderful relationship. No complaints. She is amazing. We get along great. She is very hardworking and very loving. There is absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of how the relationship is going now.

**However**, I feel like I am wasting her time with me. I feel like the relationship is good now, but I do not want kids before I turn 30. By that time, she will be 32 and with each year she gets older, pregnancy becomes more and more complicated. 

My reasoning is that I need to have a stable life before I have kids.  I am 22 right now, I have 2 years left till I finish my bachelors degree. Then I plan on doing a masters. So by the time I finish my studies, I will be around 26-27. Add 3 more years to gain a financial security before having kids, and I'll probably be ready to have kids when I'm no less than 30. My girlfriend is expecting to have kids in her late 20s, so in roughly 4-5 years. I cannot do that. 

Already her giving birth at 32 is kind of pushing the limit for me. I feel like a woman should optimally have a kid around 27 if she's been in a relationship long enough.

That's pretty much *all* it boils down to. She knows my stance on kids, but kind of brushes it away when we speak about it. I feel like I should end the relationship because her time to find someone and have kids with him is running out.

He also blamed me for not trying hard enough and staying with it long enough (When he gave nothing to  help out the entire time) and then tried to say that he gave me multiple opportunities to know the ""real"" him through well placed hints (I've told him since the beginning I'm dense as fuck, and will never get them) and I never tried.

I don't know what to make of this, can someone please explain his motives to me?

562," I want to continue to hang out with my ex, but not as a couple. He's on medication and trying to cut back on his weed habit, and is looking for a second job so he can move away from the negative influence of his old","My ex and I have been off and on for 3 years now. Many of the breakups were almost entirely to his struggle with depression (he avoided trying medication for a long time), and my disagreements with his lifestyle. We really started having problems because I wasn't okay with his habit of smoking weed multiple times a day, complete lack of motivation in college, his choice of roommates and friends (He completely shut out his old group of friends when the weed-smoking started), and his depression was putting an even more serious strain on our already fragile relationship. After several bad breakups, we have decided that getting back together isn't an option right now. He's now on medication, and trying to cut back on his smoking habit. He is also looking for a second job so he can potentially move away from the negative influence of that group of friends. And he's taking the semester off to get his mind in the right place again. Things are starting to look up for him.

Flash forward to last week, we met up again, and inevitably hooked up. Now we're in an awkward position. When things are good between us, they're fantastic. We have the same sense of humor, and my discussions with him are better than with anyone else. Not to mention that we have a great sex life. We've met up again since then, and mutually decided on continuing this more or less relationship, but just with more space. (i.e. we don't talk as much, no one else knows about it, and stay monogamous). Although we've had a great time each time we hang out, I'm feeling extremely unfulfilled at points, and there's this nagging in the back of my mind telling me that I should find someone who wants me to be his girlfriend. Because, even though my ex still tells me he loves me, I feel like a booty call. Help? I'm not sure what I should do or how I should feel.

563, GF had one night stand with a random after we had been talking and had feelings for each other. She felt horrible about it the next morning because of those feelings she had for me. She just told me about it now. What to think of it,"I spent the last couple days with my GF at her parents house and she decided to tell me a couple things when we were about to watch a movie. A little background: we've been dating roughly 9 months and she was studying abroad for 4 1/2 months in the middle. This is both our second long-term relationship, however, she has had far more sexual partners than I have in the past. 

Let me clear the air, I don't hold her (or anyone's) past against her, however, I do get weirded out talking or thinking about her past sexual encounters - which I attribute to slight immaturity and lack of experience. 

Last night, she told me that before we had started dating she had a one night stand with a random after a drunken night. This was after we had been talking and had feelings for each other. She said she felt horrible about it the next morning because of those feelings she had for me. I know this likely shouldn't be a deal at all, however, I'm afraid I was more serious about my feelings for her at the time which is the only reason that it kind of hurts. 

That happened maybe 10 months ago, so her just telling me now makes it almost harder to hear. She didn't really have any good chance to tell me given her abroad studies, but says that it really shouldn't be a big deal. I'm not quite sure if I'm right in feeling uncomfortable and a little hurt about it, or if it shouldn't even matter. What do you think?

What can we do to see eachother more than,"I'm currently 20 and my gf is 22. We both met freshman year in school but didn't start our relationship until the first day of sophmore year. So we've been going out now for about A year and eight months. No relationship is without fault or problems and one the biggest ones we have is her parents. They have no knowledge of my exsistance mainly because her father is an physically abusive controlling man so me being a threat to that control he wouldn't like it and could potentially take her out of school etc. So we agreed that I shouldn't meet them until after she graduates.

Now this is a girl I can see myself long term with probably marraige mainly because of how much fun together. Our idea of fun is just enjoying eachothers company instead of partying/drinking/smoking. Anyway because of this whenever we leave school and have to live back at home it's almost like I don't have a girlfriend. 

Yet this isn't the typical long distance relationship.. I can barley speak on the phone with her the longest in the history of our relationship was around 2mintues, texts take forever to be returned or are just bland and we even bought android tablets to video chat eachother but that's hard to do...and now nearly impossible unless every member of her family is not home. This is all mainly because her father is a professor at a different college but he has the same schedule as her so he's at home doing nothing when we're on break.

Now last summer we ended up staying at college for the summer. It was  a battle with her parents in order to get her to stay but in the end she did it and we had the best summer of my life together. Yet now this is probably the worst summer ever. Since were now at home we have to go three months! The longest we've had to bare through this was three weeks. So for three months without seeing eachother or pretty much any form of communication..It's like she doesn't exsist..Honestly it's depressing. I was wondering if reddit had any ideas to break free of the depression/form a new branch of communcation.

So today, he just drops into random conversation that he thinks he's finally found a good match on Tinder. I baulked immediately, saying that dating apps weren't intended for under 18s, so he's probably not legally allowed to be on there. He says this isn't true, and I haven't checked yet, but as he'd be happy to point out, we're not exactly squeaky clean in terms of law abiding, and he wanted to know why I objected in general to a 15 year old using a hookup app.

I've been a bit low recently, and my depression is making me foggy, so I'm not totally sure that I'm not having a knee jerk reaction for no good reason. I'm having trouble amalgamating my thoughts without the instant ""No, ew!"" comeback involved. I did point out that the internet makes it very easy for young teens to be abused and manipulated, but he says he's snapchatted with her, so he knows it's a real girl, and I can't seem to convince him that the person's gender could be the least of his concern. He's quite trusting as a person, has excellent grades, and has recently got himself an occasional job, and I'd hate to see him fuck that up somehow because he trusted the wrong person on the internet.

Both my current job, and the new one I'm applying to are in the software field, just to give some context.  The job I'm at is my first job out of college, and I've been out for 2 years.  Problem is, this new job wants references.  They gave me 4 slots on the application they wanted me to fill, but they never said they needed 4, but they never said they didn't, so I don't even know how many I need.  I also don't know who the fuck to put.  I've never needed references before.  

The obvious answer is to put my current boss, but I don't want him (or anyone else that I work with) to know I'm leaving until I know for sure.  I mean, I don't want to tell my boss that I'm leaving, get turned down by the new job, and have to keep working this one while my boss knows I wanted to leave.   That would be pretty damn awkward.

I feel like since it's been 2 years since I've been in school, professors might not be an option, and I think friends might be unprofessional.  There's a guy or two that I went to school with and did projects with, so I was thinking that might be good because we actually coded together, maybe?  Or do they all have to be supervisors?  I also have my roommate, who works for a company that's a client of the company I work for, so I could use her too?  How do I even approach asking someone to be a reference non-awkwardly, especially if it's been a while since we've talked?

Also, is it considered a bad thing to say that they can't contact my employer.  I don't want him to know I'm leaving, but I don't want them to think that I'm terrible with superiors or anything.

Me and her haven't talked much since HS, but when I look back, I miss how meaningful and open our conversations were. I have yet to this day had such open talks about life with anyone due to the changing nature of college (people graduating, moving away, getting married, etc.). 

I saw my friend at Target at the start of the school year and started some small talk about how things were, etc. A few months later I decided to ask her to hang out - nothing serious. I asked her to hang out but nothing came of it. She said she wanted to but forgot and said she had meetings and work but would try to figure something out, but again forgot.

I'm not very good at social cues especially over fb and the like, but I do really miss talking to her and want to be at least friends again. I'm the kind of person who's afraid of making people uncomfortable and my relationships suffer for that (working on it). Is there anything I can do? I mean even if I push again, the worst she can do is say no and we never talk again which is what would happen if I did nothing, right? Just not sure how to go about it. 

Below is the poem I'm tempted to send her, not a love poem but a friend poem. I did like her more than that in hs and I feel like those feelings can come back, idk. If anyone simply replies: ""You've just got to let her go, there are other fish the in sea"", I get that, that's true, I've just been lonely and desperate for a real friend - it's hard to never talk about more than the coolest movie out now or school (small talk which is what everyone I know is interested in).

I'm not good at lying and it feels awkward. However, if I told people why I'm taking medication, I could lie (antibiotics, whatever) again, but telling people that I have social anxiety or just that I take an SSRI seems like information overload and again, pretty weird. 

The people I hang out with are in my age group (21-27) and I study medicine, so my colleagues will probably know what an SSRI does. Telling my close friends that I take antibiotics all the time would seem weird too.

What can I do to make sex more","My stay-at-home wife and I clearly have different appetites for sex. In my fantasy world, we'd have sex 3-4 times a month (which I think is reasonable but I'm open to your feedback). In the good-old-days, we averaged about once per month. In 2014, we had sex 5 times. I am confident that infidelity is not an issue.

We have two kids, youngest is age 2. Raising young children is tiring and at the end of the day, my wife understandably would much rather sleep, so nighttime romance doesn't work. Morning sessions are also out because my wife likes her sleep. 

The sex itself has been pretty routine pre- and post-kids. I've suggested different positions and locations and to her credit, she has been receptive (no pun intended) but finds missionary the only comfortable position for her. We use lube when necessary, have plenty of foreplay, and I am -- ahem -- average sized so that's probably not an issue either.

In the past, we I've expressed to her my desire for more frequent sex, her solution was to schedule it (Friday and Saturday nights), which I find somewhat undesirable because it lacks spontaneity. However, I've given it a try over the past 3 years and, well, you know how successful it was in 2014. 2013 was worse but that's because we had a newborn. 2012 wasn't much better.

I feel pretty despondent about our marriage when it comes to sex. I can't find another partner (we both firmly believe in monogamy) and I feel like I can't bring myself to ask for sex because it feels like begging.

We text a lot, check in with each other daily and have a blast when we're together.

Yet I'm ridiculously paranoid that he isn't interested in me. For instance, I read into every little text and decode it as 'proof' of his disinterest. (""Oh my God! He didn't say thanks to me telling him he looked cute the other night. He obviously isn't interested in me). In another example, he canceled a date, and it ruined my weekend because I was convinced he didn't want to see me again. (We've still been talking since then; I also saw him today and we kissed. So if his cancelation were an indication of his lack of interest, he's done a poor job of following through).

I have a HP Pavilion dv6 with Windows 7 64-bit, 4 GB RAM, AMD Phenom II N620 Dual-Core Processor, and AMD M880G with ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250.  I recently moved to college and my roommates and I decided to pitch in for a better internet connection, and the only available was through Comcast.  We got the modem from them and ditched the router they gave us (we're using a Cisco Valet M10), and at first we were having little trouble, and now the only way I can get internet is straight-through.  When I woke up this morning, I could connect for about 15 minutes, and then it started messing up.  When I try to connect wireless, it usually says it's connected with limited access, but now it's saying ""not connected- no connections available"".  Windows Network Diagnostics says there's a problem with wireless adapter or access point.  I've tried system restoring, rebooting all hardware, updating the router firmware, flushing the DNS, and I can't figure this out.  I start classes in about 2 hours, so any help would be extremely appreciated.

582," I feel depressed when I visit my family, but when I live in the city I love, I feel fine. Is there a way to feel better when visiting or is there a reason why I feel this way? Is there a way to feel better","Around 5 years ago I [23F] moved out of my family home to attend school in another city that is 3 hours away. I have noticed since then, every time I come home for a holiday or to visit, I get very short-tempered and take things very personally. The only way I can describe how I feel is depressive; I cry a lot, only want to sleep, and don't want to leave my room. However, when I go back to my current city, I am completely fine. I love where I live and never feel as upset as I do as when I visit home. 

My relationship with my family is somewhat strained, and it seems to have gotten worse over this past summer when my family went on (yet another) vacation without asking me if I'd like to come. A close family friend even joked, ""Are you even a part of this family?"" when they saw all the photos from their 3 week long vacation. 

I have voiced that I don't feel completely comfortable when I come home to my mom [50F] but she doesn't seem to have much to say about that. My step-dad [49M] and I have never really gotten along and my half-brother [15M] and I don't really have much to talk about.

I don't like feeling this way and I really only want to come home at this point to see my mom because she is the one I am closest to within my immediate family. I don't really know if this is considered 'normal' or if anyone else experiences something similar, but even my mood swings from city to city are exhausting me and making me not want to visit at all.

583," I kissed a girl I met at a party because I wanted to get over my ex, but now I feel like a jackass for doing so. Has anyone got any tips on how to deal with the shame and guilt I feel after having done so","So my ex dumped me three days ago. She was my first love, so I feel devastated. Yesterday, I decided to go partying with friends in order to get over her.

After a couple of beers, a girl with a ton of tattoos, three facial piercings and an undercut joined us. She got along well with some of my friends, but I didn't really know her.

Now, my ex-girlfriend was always quite conservatively dressed. A huge contrast with this girl. I normally find facial piercings and excessive tattoos a huge turnoff. But I was drunk, and still miserable about my ex. My drunk reasoning led me to believe that if I were to enjoy myself with a girl who's nothing at all like my ex, then I'd prove I don't need her.

Yes, I know there are some terrible flaws in that logic.

So when this girl started showing interest, I took her apart and we started kissing. At the time I thought it'd feel good, but as soon as our lips touched I felt regret. She kept going though, and I didn't push her away because I was afraid of hurting her feelings.

One of my friends caught us. We were a little embarrassed and decided to join the group again. When the evening progressed, she told me she'd like my number so we could meet up again sometime. I decided to be honest and told her that I still had feelings for my ex, and didn't see myself dating anyone any time soon. She was disappointed, but she took it rather well.

All that happened yesterday. Needless to say, I still feel terrible about what I did. It felt so wrong to kiss someone I didn't care about. I feel like an immense jackass for how I behaved towards that girl. I treated her like a toy to get over my ex, and I feel terrible about it. I thought I was better than that. And now...

Fuck. I just want this feeling to go away.

So my question is: has anyone got advice on dealing with the immense shame and guilt I'm feeling?

585, I have a lot of problems with my head and can't focus on my education because of it. How can I deal with my problems in a way that I can focus on my education and not the problems of the past (or at least not so,"Hey Reddit,

I'm a 23 year old and I've taken care of myself since I was 13. My mom was really abusive and nothing I did was right. I've lived on my own since I was 16.

The past few years I've been trying to complete my education, but couldn't afford studying at the university. There were quite a few ups and downs but I always found solutions.

Right now I'm studying at a lower level so that I have time for work. Last year however, my landlord got .... creepy. He locked me inside and demanded that I stayed with him, he wanted me to go to bed with him, that sort of thing. That was really hard to deal with and I had to use my savings to find a new place on short notice, buy new stuff and move everything. The problem is that events from my childhood seemed to surface all of a sudden.

It's been a little over a year since that happened, but I often can't fall asleep at night any more because I remember things I thought I forgot. Little things at school and work are getting harder to deal with because my head is already full.

I can't get a psychological diagnosis because nobody knows if I've always been like this, or got this way through my upbringing.

I know other people can't fix my life for me or understand my desperation or sadness over seemingly nothing. I was hoping however, that Reddit can give me some advice on how to deal with a situation like this mentally. How can you put the problems of the past aside and focus on the problems ahead?
I tried physical exercise, but that doesn't work for me.

The message said ""Hey. You're so hot and beautiful. I couldn't keep my eyes off you at the party. I have wanted you since I have known you. If you ever want secret sex, let me know."" 

He sent this message after we were home. He deleted the message originally trying to hide it from me. 

He says he was drunk, and he didn't think about the consequences. He didn't think about it hurting me. He really does feel remorse, but I can't trust him again. I don't know how to deal with this.

587," I'm confused as to whether my boyfriend is actually interested in me, and if I should be concerned about it. What should my next step be, and how should I handle the next couple of weeks of no contact (due to winter break).","Basic Background: We are both in our early 20s, and go to the same college. We've been seeing each other for a couple of months, and have been exclusive for a little over a month.

When you are dating somebody else, you expect a couple of basic things. One of those things is interest, namely that you expect your significant other to act interested, and act like they want to be with you.

This is where the confusion in my relationship comes in. When we are together he acts like a normal boyfriend should. He puts his arm around me, compliments me, can't keep his hands off of me, actively engages in conversation, and requests that I stay over his place. It's when we are a part that I don't think he's interested at all. I'm usually the one that initiates conversations via text or online, and requests we get together. I've been home for winter break for around five days and he hasn't contacted me. I haven't heard as much as a peep from him in those few days. He's been a little active on Facebook so I know he's still alive, but otherwise nothing.

I've discussed this with a couple of my friends and they say that he's probably just awkward and inexperienced in relationships and I shouldn't look so much into it, especially since we haven't been going out very long. While those things are actually true, I still don't think it reflects very well on me. I have no idea if my boyfriend is actually interested in me or not, and that seems like a big problem.

Now, I'm wondering what my next step should be. We're going to be a part for the next couple of weeks due to winter break, and I don't want to go those weeks without any form of contact. Should I talk to him about what I've been feeling, or will that just stir up a lot of unnecessary conflict? Should I just do the contacting for the time being and not think so much into it? Is it really as big of a problem as I make it out to be? I have no idea what to do next.

588," I snorted Head & Shoulders shampoo into my nose, and my body went into panic mode and made me snort out all the mucus in my nose. It was a horrible experience, but luckily, it's over now.","(Yes, this happened today)

So, as per my daily routine, I shower in the morning before going to my college classes. The first thing I do in the shower is wash my hair with Head & Shoulders. As I finished lathering my hair in that lovely liquid product, I accidentally touched the area around my nose nostrils with a little too much of the remaining shampoo and didn't realize it (and yeah, the water didn't wash it off my hands, either). By the time I realized it, it was too late, as I already snorted up the shampoo into my nostrils.

What happened next was horrible: I literally winched in my pain. My eyes watered and turned red, my nose burnt with a fiery passion, and it felt almost painful to breath. My body proceeded into panic mode and made me snort out all the mucus in my nose. During all this time, my brain was whizzing out of control, and I was thinking, ""Oh my god... what if snorting this was poisonous? What if I drop dead in a few hours?"" It was around 5-7 minutes of constant snorting of mucus out of my nose before my nose (and body) calmed down and returned to a pain-free state and I could continue to shower.

Fortunately, it's been a few hours since that incident, and I haven't dropped dead (yet), so there's that to be thankful for.

She has had surgery once to remove a corn cob from her stomach (this is what spurred the trashcans with lids), and most recently, almost had to have surgery again because she swallowed a washrag, and almost didn't pass it.  I mowed the lawn the other day and found over 16 ankle socks that she had eaten and pooped out.

She was my first serious girlfriend, I had so many firsts, I lost my virginity and overall matured a lot in my opinion.

I don't blame her for not feeling romance towards me, that's just something that happened and that's ok. I would love to still be friends and talk to her about my problems and go to her when im upset.

I had been promoted to said employee's superior 18 months previously and she'd made many attempts to undermine my work, and caused conflict (all reported). My employer was unsupportive, even after his request that I speak with her resulted in her saying she 'doesn't care, and won't do what I say'. His response to me was 'fire her'.

(or how can I not hear about it again),"Since quite some time I knew that my parents had problems in the bedroom. About 6 years ago I overheard -very involuntarily- my parents arguing about this. I guess my dad was unsatisfied and wanted to have sex at least once a month, but my mum said she is too stressed out. She ""suggested"" he should just get on top of her when he needs it and she would lay there and let him. My mum is pretty agressive in arguments and always ""wins"" them.

Also my mum got her uterus (?) removed a few years ago and I think she hasn't really got a sex drive anymore.

In general my parents are fighting often, mostly at weekends or vacations. My mum's also threathening to divorce about once a year. Or probably more often, I just hear her saying that she wants a divorce about once a year. Thankfully I'm off to College since half a year and don't have to hear them fighting so often anymore.

Well now I was home over the weekend and today I heard my mum bring up my dad cheating in a fight they had about something different. I don't think they know I heard.

So what shall I do know? I wish I could just unhear it. I always knew they had lots of issues but it didn't seem that bad most of the time.

I don't like my dad less now, I guess I can understand why he did it and with me it wouldn't be an issue if he cheated and my mum just never found out about it. But I also feel lots of pity for my mum, because it must feel unbelievably shitty for her.

I know I can't fix anthing for them and these aren't my issues. I just don't know how to handle knowing this now. I don't want to be wondering how long this has been going on and how often and all this shit. Have some of you already been in the same situation? Can someone give some advice on how I can deal with knowing this? I don't want to look back later and realise that this event caused trust issues or something similiar.

For the most part, her and I have the same goals in life; we want the same future. In that regard, things are great.

But lately, every time I talk to her, I start questioning why I'm still with her.

The biggest thing is that she's very insecure, and she gets sad at the smallest things. I'm not at all trying to belittle her emotions, but it's really hurtful to have to keep reassuring her that I'm not attracted to other girls (it makes me feel like I'm a bad person or something). And though this might seem a little selfish, it really brings me down, because it seems like every time I talk to her, something small ends up making her sad, and then I have to spend an hour consoling her and making her feel better. It makes me feel like I'm a bad person. I understand that it's part of a relationship to do that, and I do care deeply about her feelings, but it's getting to the point where this happens just about every single time we talk, and it's making me begin to dread speaking to her. I want the person I'm in a relationship with to be my partner in life, but I'm starting to feel like she's my enemy in some way, because every time I say something she disagrees with, she just starts getting sad. I know that's not healthy at all for a relationship.

I do need to point out though that she's not immature about it. She never tries to guilt me, and I don't think she's trying to manipulate me or anything.

Recently I've started to hate myself for pulling the hair from the top of my head. And so I started pulling hair from my... genital regions. I'm sure you all know how fucking painful that is. Well yeah, I was doing that and I couldn't stop. It hurt like fuck and I couldn't control it.

About an hour later, I emerge from the shower and it looks like I've fucking murdered someone. Blood is running down my legs from all the painful as shit razor cuts and my whole genital region looks like I have some rare sexual disease. 

I cleaned up the mess and managed to get some sleep despite the pain. And now it's today. FUCK IT ITCHES. It never occurred to me that it'd be so painful!! I shave my face all the time and I've never cut myself and never had any itching. FML I regret it so much.

601, Boyfriend is very self aware of his height and it affects his life. He thinks I'm going to break up with him because of it. Will he grow? Will he grow in the future? Will anyone else have the same problem as him?,"So, I've been with this guy for two months and before that we were best friends for six months. 

Everything in our relationship is great but I just found out yesterday that my boyfriend is really self aware of his height and it affects him a lot to the point that he thinks I'm going to end up breaking up with him because he remembers during our friendship I mentioned I liked tall guys and that stuck with him since then. 

Now, I'm not exactly tall myself, I'm 155 cm and he is 169 cm and yes, I usually go for taller guys but I don't mind his height. He is still very good looking, he has a fit body, his funny, his charming, his intelligent and very interesting and fun to be with. 

I explained that to him but he still feels like crap and he told me is an insecurity that always affected him. 

My question is, will he still grow? His father is 180 cm and his mother is 150 cm. I read somewhere that men tend to grow until 21. He goes to the gym weekly, he is very active in general and eats healthy. Has anyone gone through the same as him? Will he grow? Again, I'm asking this for him and not for me, I don't mind him being short.

602," I want to help my friend get a permanent resident status by marrying an American girl, but the US immigration svc requires that the sponsor make enough money to support the guy applying for permanent resident status so he doesn","Dear reddit,

you've helped me out before in times of good advice, so may be worth a shot with this question as well. I am 27/m ... in case that matters.

I have a friend who is here in the US illegally currently. He is applying for a permanent resident status by marrying an American girl (go him!). So legally, she is sponsoring his permanent resident application. However, apparently the US immigration svc requires that the sponsor (his girlfriend) make enough money to support him so he doesn't immediately go on welfare. The problem is that she doesn't make enough money. He makes enough to support his whole family (he works construction off the books). So, he reached out to me because i am a citizen and i make over the required minimum amount to sponsor someone, asking me if i could be a co-sponsor. A co-sponsor makes a legally binding assertion to the US government that they will support the person in question (the guy applying for permanent resident status). So if this guy ends up collecting any sort of welfare, i will be required to repay the government. It's pretty stupid, why don't they just deny him the welfare in the first place when he applies for it? but that aside...

Is there a document i could get him to sign to transfer that repayment responsibility onto him? I do want to help him but i don't want to be exposed in case something happens and he does go on welfare. He is expecting an answer fast but i am hesitating right now...

603, I was looking for my wedding ring in a trash can full of used dip spit and found a pair of bdu's who were very kind and patient with my stupidity. I was very embarrassed and happy to have my wedding ring back on my finger again,"So this happened today. I work in a big office building at a small debt collection agency. My office is right next to a US Army recruiting station and we share a bathroom in the hallway.

 I wash my hands after using the facilities and I dry them off with the paper towels provided. I've recently lost like 15-20 lbs (not a big accomplishment since I'm still way overweight) and I throw my paper towel in the generic 3 foot tall trash can by the door. I hear a loud wet ""Thunk"" from inside the can and immediately noticed that my wedding ring is gone from my finger. Now for the fun part. Almost everybody at my job (myself included) chews or dips tobacco. And almost everybody in the Army office chews or dips tobacco, and we both spend all day spitting, and throwing out used tobacco bottles/cups in that can. Hence the wet part of the ""thud"".

 I take off my jacket, roll up my sleeve and spend the next 90 seconds rummaging around at the bottom of the nastiest trashcan in a 10 mile radius. While I'm doing this,  two soldiers walk in dressed in full uniform (bdu's) and are shocked to see a sweaty cursing fat man leaned over with his hand so far in this trash can it looks like he's birthing a baby cow. I had to keep doing these baby hops to reach all the way to the bottom and was making the stupidest noises I've ever made. I'm not surprised they offered to help (which I refused), I'm surprised they were able to keep straight faces the whole time I was putting on my own personal USO comedy show. 

I finally got the ring, washed it off with soap and water, put it back on my finger, thanked them for the offer, and walked back to my office to contemplate my life and wrap some tape around my finger over the ring. Fool me once disgusting trash can..

604," landlord sent me an email saying that I could not smoke in, on, or AROUND the property. What can my landlord do if I start smoking on the pathway that is close to my apartment and on public property (not on the landlord's property","I don't need legal advice so much as I would simply like to know what my options are in the following situation:

I live in Canada. I rent a basement apartment from my landlord. Other tenants live upstairs and have complained of the smell of tobacco smoke and marijuana smoke. We smoke outside on the property.

This is where it gets a little fucked up. One tenant upstairs is really sensitive to the smell of Marijuana because he has quit and does not want to be reminded of it.

We had worked out an agreement with the tenant, which allowed us to smoke on designated ares of the property (outside).

Then we get an email from our landlord saying that we were not allowed to smoke in, on, OR AROUND THE PROPERTY.

I understand in and on. It is his place and it's in the lease. But AROUND?  

There is a public path that isn't used very much and cuts through the block and right next to my apartment.

My question is what can my landlord do if I start smoking cigarettes on the pathway? They are legal. There aren't any no-smoking signs on that path but it is still close enough for it to potentially ""bother"" the upstairs tenants.

Also, there is a parking lot beside my apartment that is usually dead. If i were to smoke (tobacco or marijuana) in this parking lot (yes i know not a good idea just want to know in regards to my landlords power) could my landlord do anything about this? Even if the tenants complained, would it not even be the landlords issue because the problem is occurring on public property?

This is all for now. It's not even the tip of the iceberg with regards to this situation but it is what I need to know now. I'm hoping this is temporary as all of the other tenants are okay and aren't hypersensitive. This tenant is the kind the landlord doesn't want to get emails from. My landlord is a smoker and has smoked on the property, I think he was just obligated to send me the email saying that I could not smoke in, on, or around the property. Help?

605," Boyfriend and I have had issues in the past, but now that we are moving again, I feel like he is not putting as much effort into the relationship as he once did. Is it wrong for me to feel this way?","My boyfriend and I were friends 5+ years before deciding to be in a committed relationship. We have now been together for almost 3 years. During our relationship we have gone from living an hour away from each other, to practically living together, to living 5 minutes away, and as of a month ago we live an hour away again due to his job and my school situation. 

Moving so far apart again has begin to cause problems because I feel like I am getting almost no attention when he is outside of work. I feel that his video games are honestly more important, lately. When I brought this up in a discussion yesterday, it sparked a huge blow out. He stated that I am being needy. I feel that if you tell someone you are going to call them but spend 4+ hours playing video games every night instead, what does that say about how you feel about me? 

We have had issues previously but nothing to this extent. Today I was probably still a little too emotional and was upset that he didn't call during his lunch break like he normally does considering our conversation the night previous. After a long screaming phone conversation and a conversation about his priorities, he admitted that if it came down to me or his job, he would choose his job. 

Now please understand that he has only been at this job for less than 6 months (he had a lot of trouble finding a steady job during the rest of our relationship) but he is highly skilled and has already been offered a promotion. Previously we both did everything in our means to make this relationship work and would do anything for one another. When he was recently offered a position to move 8 hours away though, he told me that if I was not willing to go, it would probably be the end to us. The promotion fell through so that is no longer a question, but now I am wondering what this says about our relationship. 

I'm heartbroken after everything we have been through. Please help - Am I overreacting?!

606," I was stranded at school in the middle of the winter in a wheelchair, no one came to pick me up, had to be sick for a week because of it.
TL;DR: I was stranded at school in a wheelchair, no one","To fully understand the story you must know that i am bound to an electric wheelchair. 

It was a normal day at school, nothing out of the ordinary. Until a teacher came into the class room and told us that we could leave early today (10 am). Now i had a problem because this happened before i got my drivers license. And the way i normally transported myself back and forth was with a taxi.
Normally the taxi wouldn't show up till 2.30 pm, so i tried to get the taxi to show up sooner so i didn't have to wait, but i was told that wasn't possible.

And this is where everything went wrong. I went into rage mode, and told myself that just because the teachers couldn't plan their schedule in advance i shouldn't be stuck at school. So i had the brilliant idea of driving all the way home by myself. In my wheelchair. Out on the road. First of all it was pretty scary driving on a road where people were only inches away from hitting me multiple times, but the worst thing happened when i was half-way home. The chair gave out... I remembered, stupid as i was, that i had forgotten to charge the battery on my chair. I just made it past the road sign and was stranded at the sidewalk. So i sat there for an hour, normally that wouldn't be a problem but i also forgot to mention that i didn't bring any warm clothes and it was in the middle of the winter. And to top it all of when sitting there in misery, hating myself for being stupid, one of my friends drove past me in his car waving and smiling like an idiot, because he couldn't see that i was stranded and he just drove on. But my luck finally changed for just a short period of time. I managed to convince someone to come pick me up and drive me home. 

Now it would probably seem like this was all over, but because life happened to wanna teach me a lesson i also had to be sick for a week

Just over 3 months ago, my Ex GF and I decided to end things after a hiccup that she encountered that I found to be a ""final straw"" . We had dated on and off for over 2.5 years, basically at the level as really great friends that ended up dating when the times worked out for us. The last round that we dated, we became much closer, emotionally and phsically, though we were never official for various reasons. 

After we ""ended"", I ended up catching a drink with her voluntarily to vent my frustrations of breaking up and other problems that I felt we had encountered over the span of us dating. By the end of the conversation, we both felt much better but I was still adimit that we should stop dating, though stay on amicable and friendly terms. We also spoke on the idea that we should there was a possibility of getting back together in the future but not for quite some time.

Low and behold, not 10 days later, I end up meeting and interacting with a new girl that I really had no intentions of being involved with, but as luck would have it, I found myself an amazing girl that has provided all the solutions to the problems from my previous relationship. I am not looking into the future too far, as my current girlfriend and I have only been dating for just under three months, but I can already see a problem forming. I am wanting some guidance and advice on how to handle this situation in regards to my ex girlfriend, who I am still on friendly terms with, but from recent texts seems to want to get back together with me based on our previous conversations before my current girlfriend came along. How should I handle this?

So last Sunday my friend backed into my car leaving my friends house, and messed it up a decent amount.

At this point I called her and got her insurance policy (she has Progressive) and told them what happened and she owned up to it all saying it was her fault and everything. Now Progressive comes out and says the car, due to its age (2001 Honda Civic), is more than likely totalled. It has been taken to a shop and they said it was totalled and they are offering my the Kelley Blue Book value of the car (~$2000). Now here is the bad part....I just got a new transmission put into my car, and I have new tires and after market stereo and speakers.

609," I want to have a threesome with my partner, but only if it's on my terms. He's open to the idea, but has yet to bring it up again after my initial ""groundrule"". Is there a way to bring it","So I, [24/F] and my partner [27/m] have been dating for almost a year. I  (like everyone else) have been burned by bad relationships in the past, but have always been very open when meeting potential new love interests, since everyone is different. This is also the story with my current partner. We've also both been on either side of the coin of infidelity (both have been cheated on and have cheated on).

That being said, both of us have what you might call a ""progressive"" view on monogamy and terminology when it comes to dating. We have talked about an open relationship, but are both in such a position where we care deeply about each other, so neither of us is actively searching for new partners. It's kind of more of an ""if it happens, we'd rather know about it beforehand than find out about it afterwards"" philosophy.

The fact is, both of us have been approached/tempted, but both of us have turned down these opportunities. The fact is, we are both incredibly fulfilled by each other, and have simply not been interested in pursuing anything on the side despite being semi-""open"". We have an incredible sex life, jealousy is not a problem for us, and we are very effective communicators.

My partner [M], has brought up the idea of a FFM threesome. Neither of us has ever had one, and we're both curious. I'm pretty sexually open, somewhat bicurious, and have contemplated the idea (and I don't like the idea of a MMF threesome). I laid down the groundrule that she couldn't be a friend of ours and we should avoid developing a relationship with her post-threesome. I also would have full veto of the girl. Basically, it would be on my terms entirely. Since he caught my interest, it's something we passively bring up in conversation every so often. His birthday is around the corner, and I want this to share this experience with him.

I went to my bil wedding last week. Hes been with his now wife since may of last year, got engaged a few months after and got married last week. Hes the kind of guy that writes goals down on paper and posts them on his wall (literally). He even wrote his #1 goal as 'getting a girlfriend '. Which is kinda sweet. Hes a nice guy. We have always got along. He went through a couple of bad breakups last year, his first gf cheated on him with her boss which we all knew it was obvious but he didnt believe it until she admitted to it. Thats just a little background. Hes kind of rushing through relationships because he compares himself to his younger brother, my husband, since hes married to me and we have a 1 year old. He said to us that he wants what we have. Although its not all like he thinks it is. Life for us hasnt been all peachy and easy how he thinks. We have been together for 6 years, married for 3. 
Back to the wedding...
I was hurt that they didnt ask my son (the only grandchild)to be a ring bearer. I was under the impression that the position was taken so i didnt ask. I found out they didnt have one at the ceremony. After the ceremony they asked family and bridal party to take pictures. My son and i were completely excluded from pictures. This hurt a lot, especially because i thought we were family. Instead of breaking out in tears, i quietly snuck away and left. My husband was a groomsman so he stayed behind. He understands why i left, although he never once stood up for me or mentioned me. My mil thinks i was rude...my fil agrees that what i did was right. I felt very excluded, like an outsider.
I face them again when they return from their honeymoom next week. Any advice on how to talk this out with them? I still love my bil, i just dont know how to talk to them about it.

   First I'll just explain the situation.  So I've been with my gf for just over 4 years and while we've always really enjoyed each other's company, it's been relatively turbulent and had plenty of ups and downs.  However, she recently realised that she's been unhappy because she's not comfortable with who she is as a person.  As a person, she likes reality TV, make up, fashion, and most typical girl stuff, but she wishes she had more depth/complexity to her, especially when she compares herself to her more motivated/driven friends.

   We're both medical students so she's not dumb, she just enjoys girly things and feels guilty about it or something.  She said even though our relationship wasn't perfect, a dysfunctional relationship was a perfect distraction for her to avoid thinking about her personal problems.

   After a bit of talking, we decided it wouldn't work if we got back together right away as she would still be doubting her decision and having second thoughts, so we thought it would be best to part ways for now.  We had a tearful goodbye and I'm pretty sure we both still have strong feelings for each other, so my fingers are crossed that we might get back together in the future but I'm not holding my breath.

Over the past 4 months, I have cut out all drugs, but I still experience minor sensations similar to that initial episode, but with much lower intensity, since I am able to control my breathing. The most intense episodes have lasted no longer than 10 minutes and never take place while feeling stressed or anxious.

Last night, while in a car, I suddenly felt a sensation much more centralized over my heart and left arm. The episode was not any more intense than the first one, but it was explicitly in the heart and left arm. I went to the ER where they did the same old song and dance, blood work, Xray, EKG and saw nothing. They recommend I see a cardiologist. 

Fast forward today, I still feel pain in my left chest and can't stop shivering. I am having minor breathing problems and feel a little nauseous. My questions are, how can I help reduce these symptoms and does anyone want to take a shot at guessing what this could be?

620," I want a raise, boss only offers me another $.50/hr. What should I do when/if my review comes up and he only offers me another $.50/hr. This job should really be in the $20-22","Backstory:
I work in a production environment with one other person as the 'assistant.' The other person in the department was the 'manager.'  When the manager left for a different company I was assumed his position as manager and a new assistant was hired. The manager basically completes bills, packages and ships products, makes sure products get shipped correctly, makes sure the assistant is performing his job, and takes many phone calls from customers with questions about orders. The previous manager also did a bunch of design work, IT support and some other tasks that he just sort of picked up along  the way.
Before I took over the position, I was making $15.00/hr. the manager was making $17. (He was very underpaid IMO for the amount of work he did, see above). When I took over  my boss sat me down and informed me he'd like to raise my pay to $16/hr for all the extra work I'd be doing . I thought about it and since our receptionist makes $20+ for just answering phones and making coffee, not a terribly hard job, I felt I should ask for a raise. I asked my boss about a pay increase to $19/hr for the position and he came back with ""That's way more than I was paying  the last guy."" After  a few hours he calls me in and says ""I can bump you to 16.50 and in a few months we can have another review since you haven't really proven yourself in the position yet.' The thing is , with only 2 people in the department I already knew how, and was capable of doing  the job, since I've done both jobs if the manager went on vacation or got sick.
Here's my question.
 What should I do when/if my review comes up and he only offers me another $.50/hr. This job should really be in the $20-22/hr range in my opinion.  I don't particularly like the job, but it pays the bills and it's 'comfortable.'

621," I felt a finger poke me in my sleep, and it left a red mark on my leg. Is it normal sleep behavior, or is there a ghost in my house?
TL;DR: I felt a finger poke me in my sleep,","Ok, so over the past few years I've had a few really weird things happen in my house. Just enough for me to count on both hands. No one in my family would say the house is haunted, but we've had weird things happen. 

So about a week ago I was touched while falling asleep in bed. I was in that state of near sleep, when I feel something similar to a finger tip placed on the inside of my leg near my knee. I freeze, but the touch certainly wakes me up. Then I feel the finger tip slowly slide up my leg until it reached my inner thigh, 4 or 5 inches from my crotch. Suddenly it turns onto the nail, and jabs me very hard in the thigh. It felt like someone with a very long nail poking you as hard as they could in the leg. I jumped up and ran into the bathroom, turned the light on and waited. I checked my leg, and it was slightly red around the area I felt the jab. No visible mark, just a red rash.

Despite it being terrifying, I've been trying to keep a level head. I know that you can hallucinate as you're losing your frontal cortex and falling asleep. I myself have seen and heard things when I was young that were clearly these hallucination (ants in my bed, owls flying around my room) but I never knew if you could feel anything, or at least anything that distinct. And leave redness too? I've felt random nerves pinch before, but it wasn't like this. 

So all of you psychologist redditors, is this normal sleep behavior, or should I start looking for a new house?

I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now, and we live together, and pool money. 2 weeks ago, his brother asked us if he could stay with us during his vacation back to the US (he worked in the UK.) Well, after his 4 days were up, he got fired from his job while on vacation. I don't know the details on this, but he has now become a refugee at our apartment. He does not have a car, and needs people with him all the time. About a week before this went down, life was perfect, the apartment was beautiful and nice and didn't have huge influxes of people all the time (I'm an introvert.) and things were not stressfull. We have made an agreement with the brother to stay with us against my better wishes, because we had everything perfect. I don't want to live with my BF and his brother, I want to life with my BF. I know there's a selfless need here to help someone out who is part of my family now I hope, and I am willing to do so, but I will suffer. I even asked my BF if it bothered him that the apartment was not our own any more, and he was not that bothered. I was an only child, and my BF grew up with 3 brothers, 2 of which now are regularly at the house. I didn't sign up for a circus every day where I live, I can't take it. I am willing to try, but now that he has paid part of his rent, he has to be allowed more freedom in the apartment, but it is really tearing me up. I need advice.

624," Mum called me rude, selfish and ungrateful for wanting to go on a roadtrip with friends, who are 18 and will be in college when we go, and who she has slagged off in the past. She wants to move up the","Pretty much as the title says. My mum and I had an argument last night in which she called me rude, selfish and ungrateful for doing general teenager stuff (read: having a messy room, not really wanting to socialise, spending a lot of time gaming). This is not the issue, the issue is that I mentioned I wanted to go on a roadtrip round Europe with some friends, two of whom will be over 18 if we go in the summer (I'm in college and it'll be a group of girls) before before I have to move. 

My mum yelled at me that I only use her for lifts to work and what about her and how much she's given up. She told me if I think I'm so independent then I should get out of her house. This argument started over the clothes I wear, I wear jeans and t-shirts and don't like wearing skirts and dresses. 

She then moved on to attacking my friends (or her perceived lack of because we don't meet up a lot). This is fairly commonplace, when I was with my ex (16M) she attacked him saying he was only using me for Christmas presents, that he didn't love me because he wouldn't travel 80 miles up the country to come see me, saying he was a cunt, controlling, an asshole etc. This led to me crying a lot down the phone to him and it eventually caused us to break up, earlier this year and even then she didn't stop slagging him off to me.

My mum wants to move 80 miles up the country, pulling me out of college, where I am comfortable and am doing well, because 'there's no industry where we live now and you have no friends anyway'. 

I feel like I should have left when she told me to last night because I'm not in a good place when I'm at home, I can't go and live with my dad because he lives 130 miles up the country and it'd mean I'd have to drop out of college. She spent most of last night yelling and saying I was ungrateful, rude, selfish, naive etc, and that I couldn't handle living by myself because I'd have another meltdown due to the stress.

She said she would be dressed and ready for pickup at her house when I got there, but she would be hanging out with friends in the meantime. We had this conversation at around 1:30 in the afternoon.

I arrived at her house at 6 and knocked on the door, said hi to her parents and made small talk while I waited for her. Funny thing is, when I asked her parents if she was here they thought she was, but when they went to look for her, she wasn't. 

Then I get a phone-call from her asking if I can pick her up at her friends house because she is ""too tired"" from their bike ride. Oh and, she wants to know if my car has enough room to fit her bike.

Basically, me and Will started hooking up almost a year ago after almost a year of flirting (I was with someone else, he was with someone else). We agreed we could see other people but I never did, I had always had a little bit of a crush on him. 

But he saw other girls off and on in the past year and every time it literally breaks my heart. I didn't think I wanted to date him but I guess now I do. We hang out literally all the time: at school, friends houses, at bars. Everyone knows that we have a thing and everyone pretty much thinks we're dating but he absolutely refuses to call it that. I am not his girlfriend, we're just ""hooking up"". And I absolutely hate it. 

Logically, I know I should break it off with him. He keeps hurting me and I keep forgiving him but there's still these grudges in the back of my head. When it's just me and him, we get a long so well. But when we're in front of other people, he treats me completely differently.

So I guess what I'm looking for is motivation, encouragement, to do this because I do really care for him and I think we could be great together... but he does not share the same feelings.

640," I broke up with my ex because of his feelings for another girl, and now she's trying to get him to give her another chance, and I'm not sure how many people have had similar experiences.","When we first got together earlier this year, it was under a mutual understanding that we were both getting over our exes. We ended up totally falling for each other. The only difference was that while me falling in love with him meant that I felt comfortable enough to move on from my ex, him falling in love with me meant that his ex would stay an ex, and he wasn't ready for that. We talked it out, and we are on good terms. He's lucky that I'm ridiculously understanding, having been with someone for almost five years and not wanting to give hope that it would work out up.

He broke up with her when he was 18 and graduating high school, and hasn't really had successful relationships until me because of this ex and his feelings for her. She just broke up with her boyfriend of a year and a half, with whom she had gotten a promise ring from about a month ago. He's always regretted his decision to break up with her, but has never been able to convince her to try again. Now, she wants to.

I'm extremely upset and hurt, and I just wanted to post in here to see how many other people have been in this situation, as either the one who was broken up with for someone else, the one who was the ex they went back to, or who has broken up with someone for someone else.

641," Boyfriend's grandfather passed away, but his mother convinced him not to fly back for the funeral. Boyfriend is going camping with friends, and getting coffee with an old ex. Is this sketchy, and if so, is it a deal breaker","My boyfriend's grandfather recently passed away. He was the only living grandparent that he spoke to. He lives a couple states away, but could easily fly back for the funeral. According to him, his mother (the grandfather's daughter) convinced him not to fly back for the funeral.

That it itself bothers me, because I think that is highly bizarre. Regardless of what my mother told me, I would be hopping the next plane back - especially because money is not an issue for him.

Instead of supporting his mother and being with his family, he is going camping with his friends this weekend.

In addition, an old ex messaged him and asked him to get coffee sometime in the next week or so. He told me that he told her ""Sounds good, but my grandfather just died, so I don't think I'll be around any time soon."" Which is a blatant lie, because he didn't want to tell her no straight up. I called him out on how horrible it is to lie about such a thing, but he thinks I am overreacting.

In addition, he recently got a job that he needed to submit paperwork for. He is about 6 weeks late in submitting it and is going to tell the company if they ask that the reason is is because of his grandfather's illness.

This whole thing is really shaking me to the core, and I don't know if I am overreacting or not. I feel like to use the death of a loved one, regardless of if you talk to them or not, as an excuse to get out of commitments or as an excuse for not doing things is sketchy.. and it kind of makes me question his character. Would this be a deal breaker for you?

What can I do to make her not berate me for not saying anything when she","Important note: We are long distance, we communicate through Skype calls.

My SO has suffered from depression in the past and she is overall a very emotional person. Anyways, it seems like she transforms into someone else when having frustrations. When something doesnt go the way she wants it to or had planned, its constant crying and bawling and its very hard to deal with.

An example is, just recently she got some bad news from her school. She called me saying she got ""bad news"" and would like to talk to me about it. So we talk about it and I try my best to be supportive. 

The problem is the way she reacts to support. If I offer a solution off the top of my head of what she can do, she replies with ""ARE YOU IMPLYING I AM NOT ALREADY DOING THAT?"" to give an example. If I am hopeful about the future and say ""everything will be fine"" she replies ""NO IT WONT, X Y Z"". If I say ""im sorry to hear that"" she replies ""WELL THAT DOESNT HELP"". If I stay quiet as some people just wanna offload their problems without hearing anything, she says ""WELL DO YOU PLAN ON SAYING ANYTHING OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA SIT THERE?"".

At this point im not sure if shes overreacting or if I am just really shitty at giving support. So my question would be, which one of these is it? Its really hard to deal with this, shes so incredibly pessimistic when frustrating that it honestly gets to me. Let alone the constant berating and condescending attitude when im trying to support her, I dont think she said thank you for the support I was trying to give once.

In case im the one bad at giving support, how can I become better? What should I say? Please help me.

Our 8 year old Brussels Griffon, who is completely potty trained, has recently been peeing on the carpet in the middle of the night. He's done it a handful of times in the past, but we just figured he drank too much that day and couldn't hold it until morning. This past week or so though he's been doing it fairly regularly and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 

I figured I'd show you all a break down of a normal day for us and see if you all can spot an issue:

~7am - my wife and I wake up and get ready for work. 
~7:30am - my wife walks the dog. He always pees and usually poops

My wife and I go to work and I generally get home around 5:15pm

~7:15pm - we feed him his one meal he gets a day (for watching his weight) 

~10:00pm - I walk him again. He always pees and poops after he eats. He usually pees multiple times too since our apartment complex has lots of dogs that are always marking trees and such. 

After I walk him at night, we all go to bed.

Now at night we leave our bedroom door open to help with heat regulation and because the dog often gets up at some point to drink water. If we lock him in with us he scratches at the door causing us to lose sleep. 

We've tried locking him in with us and a water dish but he still scratches at the door and sometimes likes sleeping elsewhere in the apartment. 

I was thinking about leaving our door open for him, and just keep his water dish out of his reach for the night  but denying him water at night seems too cruel. 

If anyone here can help at all it would be severely wonderful as I'm tired of cleaning pee out of carpet.

                I think this is ridiculous and extremely rude for him to say this should happen, especially since he owes me $600.

He definitely has every right to be mad at me. But if i am pregnant I'm going to terminate it and am going to need him to be supportive and loving and not make me feel any worse about it which kind of means he needs to forgive me for fucking up so bad.

I have been dating my SO for about 11 months. We met on Tinder which I think contributed to the fact that we are VERY different people and our social circles did not cross at all. Although we have somewhat similar personalities and interests, our upbringings and many of our core values couldn't be more different. Nevertheless, I love spending time with him, we have lots of fun together, and overall he is a good boyfriend who I do love. 

However, the longer I have known him, the more apparent some irreconcilable differences between our lives have shown themselves. These are things that don't really affect our relationship in the short term, but are things that I know would make a lasting marriage incompatible down the line or in a more serious relationship. Things such as our education and the value we place on them, the way we handle finances, the importance we place on health & fitness, and our family relationships & family situations. I am currently getting my MA and he is working full time so we both have very separate lives so, at the moment, these issues don't play a huge role in our relationship.

I know that I do not want to marry this man, yet for now, our relationship is great. Yet it is bothering me wondering if I am wasting his time and my own by having these thoughts. We are both young, but our relationship is getting long- close to a year, and I know something like this may come up sooner or later. It has not been discussed yet, however. Should I stay with him because our relationship is going well and right now there's no real reason to end it? Or should I talk about it with him and possibly end things based on the knowledge that our relationship isn't going to end in marriage? I may be neurotic for thinking this far ahead but I worry that I am getting to an age where dating is a little more serious and I don't want to be doing the wrong thing.

And all those social meetings are incredibly painful for me. But I don't want my girlfriend to start not seeing her friends, I think it's important in a relationship that you keep outside contact. 

So currently I either go (very unwillingly... and my girlfriend does not like it) , or I just stay home. I feel a bit like I'm missing a part of her life. On the other hand, she does not have issues with most of my friends.

661, I have a water bottle that has a strong mold smell and black mold on the top of the bottle. It's an Under Armor water bottle. Can I get rid of the smell and mold with vinegar and water (or other things)?,"So I left my water bottle at a friends in another state for like 3 months before I could get it back. Unfortunately they didn't empty the water and clean it for me (In hindsight I should've asked them to do this.), and so there was a strong mold smell with some black mold on the rubber seal at the top when I got it back and opened it up.

It's one of those plastic Under Armor water bottles. Link below. 

I've washed it like 3-4 time with hot water and soap and still could still smell it. I put in some lemon juice with a little hot water (like how I clean coffee stains and the like) but could still smell it. Spoke to UA rep and they stated I couldn't boil the bottle sadly.

Maybe I'm being paranoid and it's all psychosomatic, but could I get some advice on how to get this out. I'm tired of using ""Smart Water"" water bottles. I read about the vinegar and water thing in the FAQ section of /r/fitness , would this help?

663, I have depression and my ex and I broke up because of it. He wants me back and I don't know if I can handle it. Can anyone relate and or have any tips on how to handle a partner who has depression?,"Short back story, I was with my most recent ex for about two years and we have lived together for most of it. We decided it best to go our seperate ways due to a few prior issues. I got a new job, moved to my own place, and I figured that would be the end of it. Fast forward a few weeks, and ge wants me back.

I was reluctant simply because I was worried our issues wouldn't be fixable. After several long talks with him, I feel deep down he has changed for the better and deserved a second chance. 

The only problem is, I am so very unhappy. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and for a while was on medication. After awhile I felt better so I stopped taking them. As of late, I've been feeling it much harder than I ever have before. I can't sleep, I have no appetite, I don't enjoy anything, and I just feel all around empty. 

I went to a wedding with a man who I very much liked but even then I just felt so down. It feels like some invisible force is just eatting away at my soul. 

I told my ex that for both our sakes, we needed to stop talking so I could get help. I told him I didn't know when I'd be ready for a relationship and that I didn't feel it'd be fair to him to watch me suffer all the while. He cried, I cried, I didn't want to let go. 

Thinking back, I think I made a mistake. I'm so afriad of being with a person like this. How can I make someone happy when I myself am unhappy? Am I being fair? I don't know how relationships work when one partner is experiencing something as terrible as depression. It affects so many aspects if a healthy relationship.  Can anyone relate?

I realized the error of my ways not long after we broke up after taking an aerial view of the relationship, and I apologized profusely about two weeks ago. We see each other and talk, have been trying to be friends. 
Today I apologized again and professed my love for him. It's true. I never want to look at anyone else in my entire life, and now I know what I was doing wrong so I can do it right again. I told him that. I told him all I want to do is make him happy, which is completely true. He said he didn't want to get back together, got up, patted me on the head, and walked away.

665, I found pictures of underage girls on my boyfriend's computer and I feel like it's a big red flag. Should I say something to him about it or am I just being a bitch? (I hope not),"So my boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years now, been living together for almost 4. I admit to having trust issues from things he's done in the past. I used to snoop through his computer/phone a lot and just get upset because I'd always find something. (About 6 months after he moved in with me I caught him texting half naked pictures back and forth with an old female friend he knew from high school, which sort of explains my trust issues.) I quit snooping for the most part the last year since I know he knows how to hide it anyway (terrible reason I know) and I've finally come to accept that him looking at porn is fine and has nothing to do with me being good enough for him. Ridiculous shit, I know. 

 
So anyways, to my point. I recently found a bunch of underage pictures on his computer and I find it pretty disturbing. They weren't fully naked, but in like revealing bikinis and ballet outfits, like 11-15 year old girls (just guessing an age range, definitely prepubescent though). He obviously didn't take them, but this is the first time I've found anything like this and I feel like wanting to download stuff like this isn't okay. I deleted them, but I don't know if I should say something to him about it. 

I know he won't bring it up to me even if he knows I saw them. I've just been trying to act like I'm not upset, I didn't want to bring it up to him right before Thanksgiving and fuck up our trip we had planned. I get that some people have kinky fetishes or whatever but I just find this to be creepy and a big turn off. 

Why would I want to have a daughter with someone who gets off to this sort of thing? I'm just curious if this is more normal than I think / am I over-reacting? Should I let it go? or is it worth bringing it up and get into a fight about it because I know I'll be in the wrong for snooping in the first place.

I don't know what to do. I've spoken with some friends, however I am reluctant to speak to my parents as they, since I've came out, have never been supportive of this relationship or even of me being gay.

It was my first relationship and I liked him...but I never felt so in love with him that I couldn't imagine my life without him. He treated me well and was nice, sometimes too nice. He cared far too much for me and I probably never came close to caring as much as he did. I was a bad girlfriend. I was working through getting over being sexually assaulted and wanted to feel empowered. The reasoning may not make sense and I'm still not sure if it ever will but at the time it made sense to me to seek attention from other guys. I wanted to feel wanted and beautiful and get over this feeling of being damaged and broken. He found out and it was the first time I felt like I needed him, but I actually needed the feeling of being wanted and being loved. It hasn't occurred to me until now that broke up how unhappy I was in the relationship. We weren't compatible and I was just in love with the idea of being in a relationship and being cared for. I care for my ex but I am not torn up about the breakup. At first I was upset and again it was just because I felt like I was unlovable and broken, but no.

So I just finished my wrestling season this past Thursday. After my last, final match for the season I just pigged out that night. I ate so much junk from the concession stand and even had McDonald's after, so naturally I gained some weight. On Friday I messed up again and ate junk since now I just feel so free. I don't have to worry about being a certain weight to wrestle anymore, and now I'm not going to be as active as I used to be. Turns out I gained 6 pounds already. On Saturday I think I did well, pizza was available at my house but I didn't even eat a slice. I had self-control on Saturday, and even went to the gym in the morning. But today? I volunteered somewhere and they provided lunch, which was of course pizza. I didn't have just one slice, I had 4 and a half. Then I had an ice cream bar, a huge bag of animal crackers, and on top of that pasta with chicken for dinner.

I don't know how to get it into my head to stop gaining. I am used to dropping weight quickly by a certain deadline, but now I will have to do it in a healthy manner.

I really don't want to blow back up in weight. I was getting compliments for my weight loss and felt good wearing fitted clothes. I want to be at my goal or below by the time prom rolls around, but once I have tempting food in front of me I can't help but have 1 or 3.

I feel like over the past 3 years, I've changed a lot as a person (personality, desires, goals, maturity and general life attitude) while she has basically not changed at all since I knew her. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, but it has definitely affected my feelings for her and my desire to be with her in the future.

This is her first ""live together"" relationship, and in reality her first relationship that has gone past a few dates at the most. I've tried to be as gentle as possible when we hit little bumps due worries about financing or any of the other usual things that pop up in relationships, but last night it came up that before we started dating she had resigned herself to be alone forever and that sometimes she has doubts about whether she is ready for long term because she's never experienced it.

I feel like that isn't an uncommon fear when you're in a long term relationship because of self doubt. But its just come to light that her parents are 90% going to go through with the divorce they've been working to avoid for nearly 3 years. To compound that fear in her she graduated in December of 2013 and is still working her way into the job market working a day job that she enjoys (school district employee, which as an aside is a bastard with its contracts and pay situation) and working a retail job at night, and I feel she is transferring her frustrations with that onto our relationship. I told her when this came up that I too had doubts,  because I do. This shit is scary, I've never contemplated spending my life with someone and for them to voice the same fears as me. 

She maintains that at the end of the day that she's happy coming home to me and our cats. I guess I'm wondering if I should try to talk to her more about it on my own or if we should seek a counseling session to help both of us open up about our fears.

Just to address one thing, I did not in the least bit force her to change schools, she is very strong willed and does what she wants. My school was her second choice and is an upgrade in schools and she hated her old one, so she chose to switch. I just happened to be a perk of this school.

681," Dad's house needs a lot of work done to sell, but he has bad credit and can't get a loan on his own. Should I get a loan for the entire amount, or just a smaller amount that would be easier to pay off (","Hi guys,

My 78 year old father recently had some medical issues (he's going to be fine), and is recovering at a senior citizen's home until he's well enough to be on his own again. However, his house is a complete mess. It needs a new roof, a new furnace, new carpet throughout, etc. etc. And to make things worse, he's also a hoarder; he has stacks of papers and books everywhere.  

He's been receptive to the idea of doing a massive cleanup and repair job to get the house in condition to sell, and using the proceeds from that to move to something smaller, cheaper, and more manageable, as well as to free up cash to pay off $5,000 in credit card debt he's accumulated. 

This is where I come in. The fix-up job will be around $30,000, and I'll probably have to be the one who provides it (I'm thinking part cash, part loan), as my father has terrible credit and can't secure a loan on his own. I have excellent credit and should have no problem getting a loan of this amount. My question is, I could come up with $15,000 that's not currently invested, but should I bother with that or just get the entire sum in a loan? I imagine the loan's lifetime would be for the repair job and the time it takes to sell the house. So, perhaps 3-9 months if the house is priced to sell. And, would I have to be on the title of the house to get the loan in the first place?

I've tried so hard to not contact her and even thought it's only been two days it feels like months and we haven't communicated in anyway except for me returning an expensive gift. I deleted her off facebook and found out she unfollowed me on instagram, which really hurt to learn. I keep staring at my phone praying that she will text me at any moment.

Midway through, we hit a rough patch where I wasn't able to show her attention because I was so busy with school and work. We kind of took a break? for about three weeks.

He kissed her, she didn't kiss back  her eyes were open, and she pulled away afterwards and felt disgusted with herself and knew it was wrong immediately. She told him it can't happen again and left.

But then they still hung out afterwards and it never happened again. Now fast forward three months, I was visiting her over the weekend and on Sunday before I had to go back, she told me everything, and hated herself for doing it and was so sorry.

I'm leaving state, and since my older sister left for college, it has been established that I am on my own financially when I leave for college.

However, I'm starting to feel like I'm already living by myself. I have to buy my own feminine hygiene products, underwear, socks, clothes, food, insurance, you name it. The only thing they provide me in my portion of our phone bill and food that they will eat (I can't ask for anything ""special"".)

I've always been paying for my own excessive stuff, like going out with friends and spending money on clothes that I don't need. But since my Bipolar Diagnosis, they pushed me away financially. We are pretty middle class.

Not only that, they don't want to do anything with me and they prioritize themselves over me constantly. 

Example. I'm into baking, it makes me happy and it's a huge stress/anxiety release for me. I asked for them to buy me a $2 baking chocolate bar. They refused, and instead went out and bought an RV that night. 

I know I'm being petty, but it seems ironic that them cutting me off came after my diagnosis.

1.  I have not once seen him hang out with friends that weren't parents of my friends.
2. He joined a church and became religious a couple years ago, but I still haven't seen him hang out with anyone outside of church activities.
3. His dating life is nonexistent as every woman he shows interest in has some flaw or another(according to him) that keeps him from going further.
4. My sister(21f) and I are college students, so we can't really be there to keep him busy anymore.
5. Also he had to move back with his mother after the divorce. I'm thinking living with ones mother for 7 years in your middle age can't be great for your self-esteem.

How can I help him develop a social life(or even start dating again)? All he has are us, the dogs, church, and work. He gets incredibly irritable if we aren't around enough.

I should also mention that I really have been a terrible son. We were never too close, as I mostly viewed him as an annoyance most of my life. After this first year of college though, I can see how hard he's worked for me and my sister, and I want him to have fun for once.

He cracked his skull and had various other injuries. He temporarily went to a nursing home and they basically helped him learn how to walk again. Currently my grandfather is back at home, but is stuck in bed most of the time. Naturally my mother and I take care of him, as our family is pretty shady and doesn't seem to give a damn.

He mentioned to us recently that he was $150 short on rent and he didn't know why. We're used to him forgetting things now, as he does it frequently. So I looked into it for him. We called up the bank and were informed that there were various transactions to Verizon and calls to an inmate facility. The card was canceled and he will be receiving a new one shortly. 

However, considering the transactions, my mother and I believe that my cousin (she's 21) has been using my grandfather's card without his permission. We didn't make this assumption out of the blue. She has a serious history of stealing from family and many other people, as well as a history of drug use. Her phone is a Verizon plan and she is the only one who has anyone in jail that she would be calling. The number used for the phone charges was even her phone number. My grandfather refuses to do anything about this, as he doesn't want to get her in trouble, but if he lets this go away without doing anything it's going to happen again. I don't know what to do to get him to see that she isn't this perfect angel and something needs to be done about this otherwise he is just going to continue to lose money.

Initially I was so happy for her. She's a very smart hard working person and I thought she really deserved it.

Fast forward to now. She has been at her school for a month. It's a very prestigious school and there are a lot of wealthy and well-connected people at attend that school. I've never really been a jealous person but recently the jealousy has been creeping in. I really can't help it. Whenever she goes to social events there are constantly men flirting with her and trying to impress her with their money, cars, clothes, etc. Even after she tells them she has a boyfriend a lot of them are still very forward with their attempts. It's not really realistic of her to avoid all these people all the time. She has classes and study sessions with them and there's a lot of social events there too. 

 I come from a very humble background and I've never attended a ""prestigious"" university before. My family isn't that wealthy and I am not poor, but I don't exactly have a lot of money either. However, a lot of these men went to very good private schools and colleges, and their families are very well-connected and well-known.

I was nearing the last leg of my journey, on the subway with one stop to go, and it went underground which caused my entire head to go numb, my stomach to flip inside out, and my vision to slowly darken... I was in rough shape. 

Luckily, it stopped in time for me to stumble out and sit myself down on a bench on the platform and take a few deep breaths and gather my bearings. Had the trip taken five or so seconds more I'm sure I'd have either puked all over the subway floor or simply collapsed in the company of complete strangers. 

After a few minutes I got up and bough a small bag of almonds which tided me over for the rest of my trip. I should have done that way before. I don't know what I was thinking.

Any help would be appreciated.","Okay, so I am completely at a loss about how to proceed from here.  So the long story version first:
I was legally divorced from my husband in April of this year.  The only asset we shared was a house.  I moved out in November of last year after he told me I had to and began renting an apartment.  At this time both he and I stopped making payments, I because I was now paying rent on an apartment and he because he had approximately $75,000.00 of debt (luckily I kept our bank accounts separate) and was planning on filing bankruptcy.  At this time we put the house on the market where it stayed for several months with no real offers coming our way.  I recommended a short-sale of the property to which my ex refused claiming it ""would not be in his best interest"".  His bankruptcy was eventually approved (he did not include the house) and has been living in the house since.  Neither him nor I have made a payment on the property since November, 2010 and he still refuses to pursue a short-sale.  At this point my credit is plunging and I don't know what to do.  We both are co-signers on the loan, however he is the primary name and the title is in both our names.

What can I do to get them more engaged in my life (or is there a better way to","Some family background to start: My parents are incredibly hardworking and extremely caring towards everyone that they meet. I also have an older sister who I was extremely close to growing up. My mom is a janitor and my dad works at a cement pipe company. Neither of my parents graduated high school and my sister didn't take much interest in school/ dropped out. 

I have always loved learning and have taken school very seriously for my whole life. I ended up at a university in Boston (almost entirely paid for) as an engineering major. I'm graduating next semester and it is the most exciting accomplishment of my life. While I'm extremely happy that I'll be graduating, I've always felt a lot of guilt because I don't want my family to feel like I think I'm better than them or that the lifestyle that I grew up with wasn't good enough. It makes it difficult to talk about college because I never want to sound like I'm bragging. 

I've changed a lot during college (in hopefully good ways) and have only gotten more interested in my studies. I love to talk about what I'm doing with my life, such as my classes, my research, post grad job offers, etc (this sounds very self absorbed...). When I go home for vacations though, I feel like these topics fall on deaf ears. No one shares my interests or really even understands what they are. I'm not even sure that my parents know what my major is. It's not a matter of them not caring (I don't want to make it sound like they are awful), it's a matter of different interests/ lack of understanding of what I'm actually doing. It's starting to get pretty depressing because I have so much in my head that I would like to share with my family but there is really no one to talk to.

Am I just being a pretentious asshole/ self absorbed? What can I do to get them more engaged in things I'm interested in? Or should I just let those interests go while I'm visiting?

I don't like it, and I don't like the fact that people don't question the sources of the information they read on reddit.","As you know, political and news-related subreddits are biased. I used to like them because while the articles may be absurdly biased and based on half-truths (I'm looking at you, Alternet), the top few comments usually pointed out mistakes and did what actual journalists should do: they used facts, sources, and (*gasp*) showed both sides of the equation that is political opinions. Recently, however, /r/politics (and some other news subreddits) has been an anti-Republican cesspool of hate and half-truths. The articles, incidentally, seem to be less biased, though not by much, but the comments use neither sources nor facts a lot of the time. For example, I get downvoted for saying that the debt isn't nearly as bad as it seems. [This comment] ( while it didn't get downvoted, explains the debt situation concisely. Anyways, these subreddits used to have a shred of knowledge, but not they seem to be filled with ignorance. As if that's not bad enough, ridiculous, ludicrous conspiracy theories are passed around like a popcorn bag that you're sharing at the movies. While I have nothing against people who believe in such theories, the fact that so many people don't even list sources astounds me, and the lack of skepticism confounds me. Such theories are meant to be skeptical, but people who believe in them are often not skeptical of the theories themselves.

712, I was a 7 year old kid who was hungry as fuck and ate a chicken drumstick that was covered in peanut butter. I was confused as to why the fuck there was peanut butter on the chicken. It was because the chicken was covered in gravy,"Like most of the fuck ups I've seen, this didn't happen today, but when I was still a 7 year old kid in the Philippines. 

A bit of a back story is that, Filipinos LOVE gravy with their fried chicken. I remember that every fast-food restaurant in this country serves gravy with their chicken. KFC and Jolibee (best filipino fast food restaurant ever!) were the best because they give out unlimited gravy that my cousins and I would guzzle. All in all, gravy was a necessity!

Fast forward to this party my aunt was hosting, food was everywhere! But of course, if you notice my username, I was looking for my favorite food. There it was, an enticing pile of golden brown, savory fried chicken. Then I spot a bowl alongside the mass of chicken that was filled with rich, brown goodness that was gravy. Oh shiiieeeeet! They provided gravy! But damn, this gravy was thick as fuck, but nothing is going to stop my gluttony now!So I took at least 5 scoops and mixed the gravy with my rice and was on my way to locate a table so i can finally eat! 

With a chicken drumstick in hand, I took a giant bite accompanied with the gravy filled rice towards my salivating mouth. Hmm, quite the distinct taste. It took me a second try to discover that THIS SHIT WASNT GRAVY. IT WAS FUCKING PEANUT BUTTER. WTF. Who the fuck places PEANUT BUTTER right next to a pile of chicken... That shit was nasty! I hate peanut butter. Only exception is Reese's peanut butter cups...

713, I feel like my girlfriend is using me as a masturbatory tool and doesn't want to do anything about it. She says she doesn't want to send pictures and doesn't like sexting. What can I do to get her to be more,"Hello~

My girlfriend and I have been together for about three months. She lives in a house with her brother and I have my own apartment. 

During the first month or so of our relationship, we were very active sexually active and things were awesome even though we both work pretty weird hours. We would usually have sex every time we saw each other. Usually, twice a week or so. It was always usually mutual or she would even initiate it. That was when she was living alone and her brother flew back down because of a vacation. 

For about a month we didn't do anything because she doesn't want to do anything with her brother at the house. Just recently, I got an apartment so we did get back to having fun.

However, it feels like things have slowed down. Right now, I'm lucky to have time with her once a week. I have to ask for it and even then she has turned me down quite a few times.

She is very involved with her work and tends to focus so much on it that I feel like I'm on the backburner. I try here and there to get attention from her sexually but she kinda just shrugs it off. I tried talking to her seriously about it a few times but she explained simply ""If I don't want to, I won't.""

She says she isn't comfortable with webcam, doesn't like sexting, and doesn't want to send pictures. Which were all of my ways trying to compromise. One of the main points of my trying to convince her to do something is that she uses porn to masturbation every night to fall asleep according to her. I have asked her if I am attractive to her and she assures me that I am. I still feel hurt, frustrated, and dealing with my self esteem.

Fast forward again to this last weekend, where I invited her to come to a party with us when she declined, not really giving a reason but still talkative.

It also isn't like I don't want to be friends with her, it's just the uncertainness, that annoys me, which is why I want to break up that friendship, could it also lead to creating a new friendship?

What's the best way to go about it? 
How would you react if some childhood friend would send you such a text? (it wouldn't be rant, but more of a text explaining why I never responded and what lead to things that are now and that for my personal well being I have to move on)

TL;DR: Older dog takes forever to do his business when","Hi /r/dogs! 

I was hoping other dog owners might have some ideas for me to try.  Here's my situation...  I have two large dogs, both black lab crosses.  When I let them out to do their business in the morning, it is still dark. The same when I let them outside to do their business in the evenings (7am-ish and 5pm-ish).  There is nothing I can do to alter that, as I leave for work around that time in the morning and I return home at that time in the evenings.  Consequently, when I let my dogs outside (at either time), I am unable to see where they do their business and as such, it's impossible to clean up dog messes until the weekend.  Frequently it snows in the interim and what I'm left with is essentially a huge & disgusting mess in the spring.  

So, I had the idea to not let my dogs out in the backyard anymore, and instead I would take them out on a leash.  That way I can just pick up the mess and it won't be left in my backyard.  This hasn't been a problem with my younger lab.  She pees on command and doesn't take long to do her other business.  My older dog, however, refuses to go when he's on a leash.  If I make him wait until he REALLY has to go, he dawdles when he's outside with me and he takes forever to get his business done.  Since I'm going to be doing this before work, I can't be outside with him for hours on end, waiting for him to wrap it up, if he even goes at all.  I am so tired of the dreaded spring backyard cleanup.  Any ideas as to what I can do to encourage my older dog (he's 13) to get his job done quickly when I take him out on a leash?

Many thanks in advance!

723," I knocked up a friend, now she wants an abortion. I don't. She is set on keeping it. I'm not. She is going to do it on her own, but I don't want that guilt. What do?","Hey, I don't really know if this is the place for this or not. I am a 27 male. So.... Oops poops, I knocked up a friend. She is 22. She didn't find out right away, so she tells me a couple of weeks in. We debated heavily for a night or two, and agreed that an abortion would be the best way to go. 

Here it is two days before the final appointment. Big surprise, she has changed her mind. Now, I'm a rational man. But I know what I want in life. And for every outcome I try to think of, this is not it. We talked for a good three hours just now about what to do. She wants to keep it. She is set on that. I don't. I just can't accept that change in my life yet. 

I'm homeless (couch surfing), I'm in serious debt, and am desperately trying to pursue my true passions. If I fathered a child, it would not be able to live the life that I want it to. And I know deep down I would always resent her for forcing this upon me. Oh, I also very recently reconnected with someone that I may love. And I want to try and work things out with her. 

Do I keep trying to convince her? Or do I take the less than savory route. She suggested that she will go at this alone, and I would never have to worry about the baby or her. But I don't want that guilt. Please Reddit, deliver for me on this one :/

About an hour into the hang out we hear screaming upstairs, and we realize someone is yelling her name. This was incredibly alarming because we were the only ones home. Then we heard her mom open the door and scream ""GET UP HERE RIGHT NOW"". So the girl sprinted upstairs and I was in intense shock but from what I can recall her mom screamed something about me being ""done"" and ""having no respect for her family"".

TL;DR: I feel worthless and lonely, and I want to meet people","In school (well, anywhere, to be honest) I've always felt incredibly left out. No one talks to me, or even acknowledges that I exist. And, honestly, I never have anything interesting to say anyways, so even if they did talk to me, I don't know what I would say.

So I started college today hoping things would get better, but they didn't. People still refuse to talk to me and I really can't understand why. I've been reading Reddit for advice on this a lot lately, and everyone just says ""Walk up to someone and say hi"" but for me it's never been that easy. Besides, no one has *ever* done that to me, so I'd feel weird if I started doing it to other people.

I was homeschooled most of my life, which messed me up pretty badly. I've never had any real friends, and I can't make new ones simply because *I don't know how*.

I'm really tired of being lonely, Reddit. I don't know what to do. I'm not an interesting person to talk to, and I just can't bring myself to talk when I'm around people I don't know. I suppose I have selective mutism that way. What are some ways I can improve myself? I don't think I'm terrible ugly, and I dress nicely, so it's nothing like that that's turning people away. I can't drive, and I don't live in a dorm, so nothing that requires either of those. I feel like I'm going to be Forever Alone, and I really do want to meet people. I felt worthless today when in my last class I just sat there, and no one would sit next to me.

Well, I started a few months ago and they wanted me to go to the training which was about 4 hours away. Now I was OK with this until they told me that I would not be able to travel by myself, I needed to carpool with the others that are going. Now, I hate these people and I refused to go with them. So I came up with the brilliant idea to tell my district manager that I needed to drive by myself because I had IBS. My DM said that I would need to provide a doctors note in order to be able to travel by myself and be reimbursed. Now, she gave me until January 1st to get the doctors note, I would be able to skip this years training and then attend next years training. I was OK with this until today.... I tried to get a doctors note for IBS and the doctor out right refused to give me one.

The doctor said that IBS is not embarrassing and he would not write me a doctors note to allow me any special treatment at my employment. I was stunned, because I wasnt asking for drugs, just a stupid little note that said ""JohnnyCrusade needs to be able to drive privately and have access to a bathroom at all times"", but instead this doctor just refused. So now I am getting a little worried that getting this stupid doctors note will be harder than I thought AND if I dont get it, I may lose my job.....

And to make matters worse, I just got a new apartment that I am going to be moving into on January 1st which may also be the day I lose my job....

When i showed up for my first day of training i met my trainer and instantly had what i call a ""middle school crush"" on her, being that i felt i liked her without really knowing much about her. Immediately i wanted to ask her out especially knowing that i only had till the end of the week then i would lose contact with her (i work at a different store than i trained at). After talking to her a bit in our small amount of free time i felt we may have a connection because we flirted quite a bit.

 I decided i wanted to ask her after the training had been completed because i felt it was more professional, which was important to me since it was a new job. I was just going to ask her out to something simple like coffee but when the day came we got really busy in the store, and at the end of the day the manager wanted to go over a few things before i got sent to the other store. While i was talking to the manager my trainer's shift ended and she left, thus leaving me without a chance to ask her out.

 I know i messed up by not just doing it sooner, but my question now is how can i still ask her out. I had gotten her phone number so she could send me my training schedule, and had considered just texting her about meeting up for coffee but im not sure if that's to impersonal.

In his breakup text he said that he met another girl but liked both of us and wanted to try having a relationship with her because she's closer.

Do I have a right to be upset and hurt? I told him that I love him when this happened and that I believe this was all about sex for him. Is it wrong of me to have hope of getting together in the future? I'm not going to be waiting around for him though. We're trying the 'just friends' thing right now.

Yes, we're younger but please rest that aside. We've been dating for nearly 10 months now and things have been pretty good. Your usual up's and down's but other than that its been great. This is the longest relationship we've both had (my first and one previous to this was 2 months, her longest, not last, was 8 months).

A few months ago (2-3) I gave her 16 cards for her birthday, all relating to us somehow. For example, a kiss card. Anytime, any mood I'll have to kiss you if card is present. Another card was a truth card. With 5 redeemable passes. A few months ago she used one to ask me if I masturbated. I answered honestly, yes, and as the conversation moved on, she admitted to it as well, saying she started a month prior to the conversation. I was fine with this at first, but lately I've felt uneasy about it. 

Being teenagers we're curious. And me being the guy, I'm naturally more curious than her. We have agreed no sex, and she's not interested in oral or letting me do that so our limit is grinding and touching over our underwear. I've never reached climax that way, but she has. Once on my 16th birthday. We used a massager I use after I run and she got off that way that time. However, it's only been that time. Never again.

So when she tells me, ""oh hey, 44"" (she updates me on when she does it, 44 is total times since she started) I feel badly. Like I'm failing and not ""doing my job"". I'm not sure how to understand the feelings or tell her I feel this way. She knows I do it as well, and I update her too. Yet, every time we mess around and things heat up I feel like I'm just making a fool of myself by fumbling around down there and she just has to lay there. 

How do I overcome those feelings and tell her without giving an awkward or scared vibe? I'll feel free to provide any details if needed.

738," I chase numbers because teachers tell me to, but feel like I've lost sight of the side of education that can't be quantified and measured. Is there a better way to learn, or is the system just wrong?","As a freshman in college, I have learned that numbers mean everything to a student. I chase high numbers on tests and assignments in order to earn the grades I want from my teachers. The grade I receive on a given assignment (exam, project, homework, whatever) is based on how effectively I have banked the knowledge provided to me by the teacher, and the effectiveness with which I wield that knowledge. But why do I pursue these numbers with such fervor? The fact of the matter is because I have been told to do so. 

Among the knowledge, values, and opinions that have been deposited into me during high school, more often than anything else I was encouraged to continue onwards to college. The main motive for doing this, as my teachers oft explained, was the importance of a college degree when entering the work force. Get a degree for the numbers, they were telling me, think of the paycheck. 

Rarely, if ever, did my teachers expect me to continue my education out of a passion for learning. While I understand and agree with the importance of a steady income in providing a certain quality of life, I feel like I've really lost sight of the side of education that can't be quantified and measured, and just see higher education as a means to an end. Basically I'm chasing numbers, good grades=degree, degree=job=money.

I'm not saying the system is wrong, I just feel as though there should be more focus on applying knowledge, and acquiring real experience with that knowledge. I have all this info stored in my head, but have no idea what to do with the vast majority of it. Is this my fault? Should I just know how to use this knowledge in a creative manner?

One day, I approached the usual traffic light at an intersection between the two high schools. I passed a group of boys from the boys school and there was a pause - then they burst into hysterics. I didn't bother associating with them and didn't even spare them a second glance. I had a social studies assignment to hand in and I really didn't care about whatever they found funny.

The social studies assignment box was located on the upper floor of the biggest building in the school. So, being the lazy bastard I was, I decided to walk *diagonally* up the stairs just so I didn't have to walk as much. After I dropped the assignment in, I walked *diagonally* down the one of the other two remaining flights of stairs.

My first class was maths, then I had social studies. Maths class was uneventful and I headed back to the social studies building with my friends after class.

I did make sure that last time I saw her I walked her to her next class to see if she got the hint that I am interested.  Another thing, I'm about 5 years older than her but were both in our 20s.

So next time I see her, should I try and give it a shot at asking her out or should I just let it flow and just be friends for now?

I am getting married next March. We are inviting 100 people but are not planning on all of them attending (probably more like 70-80?) The planner in me has already got a lot of big details nailed down (dress, venue, caterer, photographer, some decorations, etc.)

We are deciding between two kegs, and doing the whole ""canoe filled with ice"" thing for ciders, white wine/champagne, and sodas, etc. or just having the canoe (or metal bins with ice) filled with everything. The venue has a really cool old bar we can use for serving, but obviously the canoe would be outside (wood floors in the hall).

My question is, has anyone successfully pulled this off without a bar tender before? I would think my guests could serve themselves without issue, but for some reason I'm worried about it. My coordinator could possibly help ensure the serving goes smoothly, but she suggested hiring one of her BILs to help man the bar. I don't mind this but I don't really want to pay anyone else.

First a little back story and then I'll explain,

I'm currently 26 and have been classified as a 'primary insomniac' since I was 18.

Since it started I average about 3-4 hours medicated sleep (currently on a cocktail of Flurazapam and Mitrazapine (Remeron), with the occasional large shot of scotch if it's a rather bad week... Also, I run 6-9 miles a day on top of a daily workout to wear myself out...

I started with diet, moved on to melatonin, then went in for the endless sleep studies, a sleep psychiatrist (who had me on double the recommended dose of Ambien before I walked out of his office)...

I've tried every major sleep aid, prescription and over the counter, as well as some heavier meds that I've been given in small amounts because of their addictive nature...

The nature of my sleeplessness is both falling asleep and staying asleep, my mind races when I try and sleep and I'll also sit straight up in the middle of the night with my brain yelling 'you're up now get busy'...

The only times I really sleep are if I get a migraine, which isn't much of a trade-off...

I've been talking to people about relaxation, meditation, acupuncture, yoga, etc. because I'm honestly out of options at this point and was wondering if anyone has tried/had any luck with any of those options.

Any sort of insight or advice would be greatly appreciated,

746, I have a stress reaction in my foot that has been causing me to run with a boot on my foot and I want to get rid of it and get back to running without the boot. What shoes can I try out that might work for me and,"Fingers crossed I get clearance from my Dr tomorrow to get out of my air cast and scooter situation and start tapering back into full weight-bearing life including exercise and eventually running! I've spent since the beginning of April trying to get a stress reaction to heal in my cuboid.

I tried on my road running shoes a couple days ago (to test if I felt my foot was healed), which are Brooks Women's PureFlow 4. I remember noticing a significant change in make between the 2s and the 4s. There was a puffiness about the 4s that I didn't like, but they felt okay. Trying them on months later I can feel that the arch support is far too forward for my feet and causes me to shift my weight to the front outsides of my feet. Thinking that the poor fit might have contributed to my stress reaction (there were definitely other contributing factors).

New shoes will be needed shortly and I am looking for other brands to explore that might fit like the Brook's PureFlow 2s did. Something light weight, not a ton of cushioning, roomy toe box but not wide over all. I had been running in Brooks for a couple years and prior to that ran in Asics (Nimbus and Cumulus) and ended up ditching those because they felt heavy and I couldn't wait to take them off. Previous to my injury I was wearing Saucony Peregrine's for trail running.

—————————————————————————

I have been fitted and go to a running store to get my shoes. I will be asking them for suggestions as well, but sometimes they are busy and I like to go in with a couple of ideas of brands to try. I have found shoes I like more successfully that way.

748, Boyfriend ignores me when I ask for communication. He has finals and says he may come home later than planned. Should I wait until he gets home to talk to him? Or talk to him when his finals are over if he is still ignoring me,"BACKGROUND: I'm in a long distance relationship. I started dating my boyfriend senior year of high school and we continued our relationship even though we chose different universities. We are both juniors in college right now. We also did not date during sophomore year of college, but we got beck together. 

WHATS GOING ON NOW: Well, it is finals week for the both of us and I get that he's really busy with finals. He pulls all nighters all the time. I am not a clingy person and I'm very vocal about my feelings. I was the only one calling or texting and I was not getting a reply back. I was getting annoyed so I stopped contacting him. He never even noticed. So, finally I told him that all I wanted from him is one text a day or a quick 2-3 minute phone conversation. He only did this once this week and now he continues not to talk to me. I also feel like he only called me because he wanted to ""shut me up"" about having no communication.

I get that he's busy and I don't want to bother him, but it's kind of hurtful. 

I'm giving him his space, so he won't stress out about me and focus on his finals.

His finals end tomorrow and he said he may come home later then planned because he wants to spend time with his friends. I got a bit upset, but I told him it was fine. He said that we have a whole month together. But my point was that he had a whole semester with his friends and he has all of next semester, we rarely see each other.

Is it possible to do that and if so, how to handle it?","Me - not experienced with dating. All past relationships have been long-time friends.

Girl 1 (let's call her Amy), met online and went out for a coffee recently. Flirted. Really attracted to her. She says she likes me a lot too and I can feel that. It feels natural to make a move towards physical contact and I know we both want it. I'm not sure we fit super well on personality spectrum, but I can't really tell after one coffee date.

Girl 2 (and this one will be Beth) - a friend I get along well with and had a crush on for a bit. We are similar kinds of weird. And she is an integral part of a friend grup I recently started spending my time with. Asked her out, nothing happened and was slightly awkward. Hanging out was still fun. Yesterday we chatted after hanging out with friends (online chat after we both left). She says that if I want we could be a thing. I say yeah let's give it a shot. There was no physical contact and I feel awkward about initiating it. She also warned me up front that she's awkward about this kind of thing. Yeah, there's a lot of potential awkward there.

I'm confused about how I should approach dealing with that. I'm not sure if things with either of them will work. I am sure that both of them can potentially work. I don't want to choose now when I know so little about two potential relationships. Do I have to choose now? I feel like ideally I'd just hang out with both of them and see how things develop. Is it acceptable to do that while pursuing things romantically both ways? What are the conventions? HOW DO HUMANS WORK?

Her : 25

Known each other 6+ years, as lovers/friends.

We have been together 8 months now. We have had this problem in the past. She takes medication in which one of the listed side effects is decreased sex drive. She also takes birth control. We have sex maybe once a month, if I am lucky. It's a chore for me to even get that. I am always the initiator. 

She uses excuses like she lives with her parents (we are moving in together soon) and of course blames her medication to some degree (which she is slowing weening herself off of) but it bothers me that I always have to start things and that she downplays the frequency.

She says things like, ""It hasn't been that long!"" But yes, my friends, it has. We are like the old married couple. I might get a blowjob for my birthday. 

So naturally because of this, I constantly look at and fantasize about other women. I don't think about her when I masturbate and I watch a lot of porn now.

I should add that in the past we would have regular sex but that got interrupted because I was having ED issues. I saw a urologist and am perfectly fine now. I guess time will tell when we move in together - but I am pretty sure it's going to be more excuses when we move in.

Forgive me for venting my crazy.

So I have been dating my boyfriend for 3 months and things have been going amazingly. He is very sweet and caring, smart and communicative, the sex is the best we've both had, and we see a future together. I feel very secure, or at least I thought I did...

Recently due to current events in the US, we were discussing college drinking culture, then consent, then statutory / age differences in sexual relationships and the ability to consent. We talked about the power imbalance that may occur between a younger and older person. This was a really stupid direction to take the conversation, but we then discussed how large of an age gap we had ever experienced. I know, I shouldn't have let my curiosity get the best of me.

Soooo I know that he went on a tinder binge last year (and possibly earlier this year before we met) after his last breakup which was kinda traumatic and he didn't want a relationship for a while afterward. I'm fine with that, I've had my share of casual sex. But, basically, there were multiple girls he hooked up with who were 18 or 19 years old.

I know he is with me now, and we are falling in love, and I have no reason to be paranoid, but for some reason I cannot get this out of my head. Maybe it has to do with me aging, maybe it has to do with the motivations and creep factor of a 29/30 year old man pursuing a college aged girl.

Am I crazy to feel this way? I know I need to be more secure, that this shouldn't bother me, but I am an imperfect person. How do I make this less intrusive in my thoughts and less nauseating? Like, I literally get nauseous and I think it is starting to make me emotionally withdraw from the relationship. I don't want this to happen because I haven't felt this strongly about someone before and I know it is irrational...is it?

I allowed it to take over my life to the point of negatively affecting my friendships, mental health, and grades. Most embarrassingly, I didn't look for jobs yet even though I just graduated because I wanted to wait for him to decide which city we wanted to move to, so now I also don't have a job or a plan except my shitty part-time job and it's already June. I am frantically trying to get my shit together now, but I am still reeling from heartbreak and I find it difficult although I know I need to take action.

In retrospect, I now realize that I consistently make bad choices in relationships to always be the one sacrificing more. Or to allow relationship drama to completely overtake my life to the point of affecting my work ethic, time for hobbies or friends, etc. I would like to learn to make myself, rather than the people I date, my top priority. And to take responsibility to not end up in situations like this again. Any success stories to give me hope or strategy?

But I know for a fact that through all the struggle and negativity, we wouldn't let it get a hold of our relationship and we always found a way to talk things through. A few days ago, I don't know what came over me but I simply had enough and whilst texting I told him it's over. He was obviously shocked and I was shocked at myself for doing so, but everyone told me it was the best thing to do. 

How is it the best thing when all I'm feeling currently is regret and just, sadness? He messaged me telling me he's never been this hurt by me before and that he wants to kill himself. I genuinely feel sick to my stomach just knowing I did it that to him, especially considering I love him so much. I keep on hoping that time will heal, but what if it won't? There were many red flags and, at the end of the day, it's more good than bad that we broke things off.. I just can't understand why I'm feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt and why I want to take back what I did.

**YYZ > JFK > SFO** then **SFO > LAX > YYZ**

I booked this before figuring out that she really wanted to see LA. I booked all of us Virgin Air flights to LA thinking what the hell, she connects in LA anyway.

Just to make sure I called American Airlines to double check it's cool that she miss the SFO > LAX flight and just hop on her LAX > YYZ flight home. Hell, maybe they could fill that seat with someone else. That's when I am told that there is NO WAY that they would let her on the flight in LAX as it would be considered canceled when she no shows at SFO, even thought I am on the phone telling them she is already here. The only option is to change the flight for one low cost of **1200 dollars plus a 200 dollars change fee, this is TWICE the cost of the entire return trip**. At least they were nice and offered me the option of booking her a $300 additional flight to take a red eye home tonight from LA to SF just so she could catch her SF to LA.

If it were just me I would show up early and demand I get on the plane but I can't expect my sister to do that. I just bought a whole new ticket on US Airways and I cannot believe how ridiculous this is. Does any one have any idea of what I can do / could have done?

767," I think Aria's ex is still in love with her and may try to make a move on her when Evan isn't around, and I don't know if it's my place to tell her to stop it, or if it is.","So here's the story, names changed for privacy. I live with a couple, Evan [the 22m] and Aria [22f]. Aria's friend Michael [30m] recently moved in with us. Michael is not only Aria's friend, but also her ex-boyfriend. It's been 2 years since they dated, they've been friends in the meantime, and Evan was cool with it, so I was also fine with him moving in. 

It is very obvious to me based on body language, and actions Michael does towards Aria that he is still totally not over it, and likely still in love with her, even. He makes food for her, rides the bus to her work (about an hour bus ride each way) for the sole purpose of riding the bus back with her, and as much as possible when Evan isn't around, he positions himself as close to her as he can. It's painfully obvious to me and Aria doesn't do anything to try to brush it off. She's a very attractive girl, and I think she thinks of actions like this from men to just be commonplace and almost expected. I am 99% sure that she would ever cheat on Evan, but it seems to me that the possibility of Michael making a drunken move on her when Evan isn't around is definitely likely, in which case he would probably need to move out of the house and the remaining housemates would have to eat the cost of his rent.   

Should I talk to Aria about it? Or Michael? Or is it really none of my business?

 When we first had sex, she wasn't on birth control and it was both of our first times. After about 20 minutes of intercourse and foreplay I look down and my condom looked like it was leaking and that killed the mood. Even if it wasn't and I was just foolish.

Then a few times after the first time we had sex while she still wasn't on birth control the condom slipped off and her period was late. I lost sleep over the worries of pregnancy. Even when she finally got on birth control the condom broke and I couldn't sleep.

Even though she is on birth control she is very careless about the exact time she takes it and often misses pills by a few hours.

Now every time it scares me so more recently when we try to get in the mood I find myself pulling away from sex and settling for giving her head. I have told her about this and she seems to understand but now it has been nearly 3 months since we last had sex and I can't seem to bring myself to be brave enough to have sex again.

Not sure if she is just being friendly, or flirting. (i'm dense with women, i don't pick up on small signs). Now, at the beginning of me being rejected after asking her out we decided to be friends, but when we hang out there is obvious sexual tension, I flirt a lot when we hang out and she seems to enjoy it and we laugh and have fun when we hang out, and I have been keeping myself from escalating because of the agreement to be only friends.
  I was thinking of giving her the teddy bear on Valentine's day with a note and an attempt to escalate the friendship into something more. Should I attempt to turn this into a dating relationship or just drop it because I think she has feelings for me as well.

So just the other day my boyfriend was complaining about how his expense is extremely high this month and how he might not make his credit card payment. He stated his car payment is high. And since he's in sales, so he always have to make expenditures first, and then wait for company reimbursements. So basically most of his expenses will be reimbursed the following month. Then he turned to me and said half jokingly ""and you are expensive.""

I didn't say anything back to him. Because I honestly didn't want to argue over it. But it's been bothering me ever since. I don't see how I'm ""expensive"". Whenever we go out, I pay for myself. That includes meals, transportations, entertainment, etc. We've always been half half. Whenever I go over to his place, I sometimes bring food, sometimes pay for takeout. So that he's not paying for grocery for TWO. 

The only time that I am an extra ""expense"" is when he buys me flowers, cookies, etc. The simple romantic thing. I always thought that was nice, but I never thought that those things are EXPENSIVE.

It's not like we go out everyday or every weekend. Probably once a month we'll go out and have a nice dinner, avg out to be 50~60 per person, which again, we split. Whenever I want to go out and do something, I always think of cheap things to do: animal shelter, gallery, movies (free tickets from me). Because I know he's always worried about his expense.

We are both working professionals and he makes more than me. I don't understand that if we share the same ""expense"", if I don't even think that he's ""expensive"", then how can he say the same thing to me?? Seems like all he wants to do is stay home, watch tv and have sex. That's not expensive. What he said to me just bothers me so much lately I don't even know how to approach it.

The only time we have a decent time together is when we smoke, but even that has become dull.

There are a ton of reasons why I stay with her. I have no one else. If I break up with her, I would literally have no one. The other big reason is because we are planning on rentin an apartment. If we split the rent and bills, we will be fine. If we were to seperate she would not be able to afford to live by herself. I am worried she would have nowhere to go. I am also very worried because I don't want to break up and then realize I wanna be with her. If I break up with her I know I cannot continue to talk/hangout with her.

786," I have two cats that are very destructive when not supervised. What can I do about it, or what has been your experience with rowdy cats? What can I do about it, or what has been your experience with rowdy cats? What can","So I'm asking for some advice (not really sure if this is the right place; it's my first time on r/cats) and I think it'd be best coming from people who like/love/own cats. If there's a better place for me to post this question, please give me your suggestions.

A couple months ago, we rented out our extra bedroom in our house to his friends: a young couple who own two cats.

NOW, I like cats. I've lived with cats for a while, but never really owned one that was ""mine"" and my responsibility. The cats I HAVE lived with were indoor and seemed happy that way-- mellow, sweet, perfectly happy wandering around inside a nice-sized house. However, these two cats I live with now, are VERY rambunctious and wild. I've never seen anything like it-- on tables, on counters, knocking over stuff, scratching things. I understand that cats do this, especially when they're still young, but usually you can train them to stop. These cats don't stop. Ever, no matter what we do. (mama-catting, using the motions sensors, scolding, ect.). They are unusually destructive. Even the rowdiest cat I ever had eventually quieted down after a few months. 

I am really the only who observes the cats much because I am home more than anyone-- I work partially from home whereas everyone else is gone from 7AM-7PM. But the point isn't that I'm sick of having to babysit them every morning. I think the cats' behavior is because they are bored and restless, not necessarily because they're untrainable. 

Could putting a cat outside solve destructive behavior like this resulting from boredom? My boyfriend agrees. Our roommates are in denial about the destructive behavior, probably because they spend next to no time with the cats. What has been your experience with rowdy cats? What did you do about it? What can I do about it? (other than the obvious-- eventually having to ask the roommates to move out).

She wants to set up the second date before the first one's even in the books. 

Second date is even better. Lots of easy conversation, laughing, lots of physical contact. We both seemed to have a fantastic time.

Four or five days later, I suggest a third date, she says she would love to but can't make it. SHE SUGGESTS we meet up the next day instead. I picked the place, but SHE PICKED the time. An hour before the meet up time, I text her to make sure she has the address because she doesn't have internet access in her apartment. This is the conversation: 

Me: ""Do you have the address or are you hindered by your shocking lack of technology?""
Her: ""?...oh shit...I can't make it! Sorry!""
M: ""Yikes. Well ok then. I guess it's a good thing I texted you.""
H: ""Yeah, I'm so sorry. I feel really bad.""

And then that's it. She vanished. Worst part is we live about 30 min away from one another, and the place we were going to meet up was in her neck of the woods. So I would've been standing there with my thumb up my ass had I not been such a nice friggin' guy.

I'm not going to insult my own intelligence by asking y'all if I should ever have anything to do with this chick again. My question is: What leads an adult human being to be this inconsiderate of the time and efforts of someone who, even if you've decided you're not romantically interested in this person anymore, is at the very least someone you obviously enjoy spending time around?

Once of my classmates decided to do the same thing and its been about a month since we started classes. He's fun to be around and made friends very easily back in college. I was the opposite and kind of stuck to the two people that I'd known from high school.  

In college we never really spoke to one another except for group projects and the odd question about assignments, so I'm kind of surprised that now we sit together in every class and hang out at lunch. I tend to not be very talkative and head to areas where not many people are; this results in us being alone or separated from the more social side of the class most of the time. 

The reason I'm making this post is because I feel guilty that my lack of social skills is holding him back from making friends. I'm perfectly okay, and sometimes more comfortable, being by myself but I know that isn't the case for some people.  Have any of you been in this kind of situation if so: what should I do or ask to make sure I'm not isolating him from others, and encourage him to make more friends?

I have been trying to get into law enforcement as an officer for the last two years. I currently work in a jail. Before that I worked doing technical support for one of the largest technology companies in the world. I resigned from there to be in LE.

I passed the gauntlet of tests and went in for a board interview and met five senior members of the police department. The board was going great and I had even managed to break their poker face once or twice. I've figured I've got this in the bag when they ask ""What is one traffic offense that gets under your skin so much that you'd write it every time?""

I'm over here licking my chops because I knew it was coming. Every LE interview I've had, they ask a question where it's a no win situation. I go back to the well on this one, although it is completely truthful. ""DWI.""

As expected, ""So what you're telling me is you would take the captain here to jail, who is set to retire in three weeks?"" ""He made that decision for me when he climbed behind the wheel of a 4,000lb object, drunk."" ""Isn't there anything else you can do?"" ""No.""

That's a normal dialogue with them trying to see where you're at. So they ask me one more question, and we close the board. Right as I'm about to leave, the guy who seems to be running the board stands up and throws me a screwball.

""Have you ever heard of professional courtesy."" ""Yes I have."" ""Counting all city, county, state and federal agents, less than 1% of everyone are police officers and we have to have each other's back."" I just stared at him, completely shocked. I look over at two more board members who are staring at the guy like, ""uh what?"" So I walk out.

There's three slots. Only me and one other guy made it through the previous stages, I'm still thinking I got it. I get the call that I wasn't ""recommended for employment."" No explanation, but I know why.

She was skeptical and we had a very straight forward conversation about what each of us wanted.  She had just gotten out of a relationship and said she wanted to take things slow so that she could work on herself.  I told her that was reasonable and lined up with what I wanted, since I'm slammed with homework, job search, and an approaching graduation.  

We've done everything together -- even gone on vacation with each other.  Which is and was totally cool since we were such good friends before.  But now it almost seems like I can't give her adequate attention.  It's literally every day that I have to spend with her otherwise she'll question my loyalty and feelings towards her.  I told her that I didn't want to travel 2 hours over Easter to eat with her family and that I would rather make solid progress on a school project.  The week after she wanted me to make the same trip on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday; she got mad when I told her that I had other things to do.  It's not even like I've never met them...I've eaten with them multiple times...this month.  I've literally seen her family more than I've seen my family all year. 

I like her to death; shes cool and a sweet friend.  But fuck, I need *me* time.  I need to focus on *my* life.  I can't give her the attention that she requires let alone give myself the attention that *I* require.  I'm graduating in two weeks, have two term projects due next week, 5 exams the following week, and don't even know what the fuck I'm doing with my life after.

Basically it started because I started dating a guy in their friend group that one of them liked. I had no way of knowing that, and didn't know until after I started dating my boyfriend.
  
  
Last semester my boyfriend was abroad and the harassment got worse (I'm talking people banging on the door to my room and calling me a slut and whore through the door, among other things). So I met with one of the Deans of our college (she is also in charge of the Honor Code at our school) and asked for a no contact order (basically a restraining order) to be placed between one of the girls and myself. I struggled with that decision as I did not want to make the harassment worse. 
  
  
The harassment never stopped, but I had been really sick this semester and had some family crises at home (I was on medical leave for over a month and there was a situation where my mother- a school principal- had been targeting in a serious school shooting threat) so I just met with the Dean to report a violation of the no contact order.
  
  
The Dean [F50ish] proceded to tell me that she didn't know if she could do anything about the further harassment because she ""can't force people to be nice to others"" and because the biggest incident was in February. Additionally she said that I had been harassing the other girls involved- and one such way was that I had filed for the no-contact order (wut?).

I don't feel any less in love with my boyfriend, but simultaneously, I have a crush on my friend, and I find myself thinking about him quite a lot.

Backstory: before I got with my boyfriend, we weren't really friends. It was as though as we got closer than acquaintances, we sort of surpassed the platonic friendship stage, and our relationship developed right away as both friends and lovers simultaneously. I also wasn't desperately keen to get into the relationship - he had feelings for me for ages, before I started to return them - but my affection for him grew just before the friendship/lover stage.

It's different with my friend - we've been friends for a while, and my feelings for him developed much more organically and naturally than they did with my boyfriend. We talk constantly (much more so than me and my boyfriend do - I try to start conversations with him over FB or text, but sometimes he mightn't reply for hours), and I look forward to seeing him so much, even get butterflies, all that crushy bullshit. I have feelings for him for similar reasons I have feelings for my boyfriend - they both make me laugh, they're both intelligent, etc. 

Don't wanna sound like a loser, but it's basically ""it feels so wrong but it feels so right."" I feel slightly guilty for my feelings for my friend, but that's often overrided by how much I enjoy his company. (We haven't kissed or anything.)

I'm also just really hurt that he hasn't come back in any form, because everyone always has guys come back (especially when there was no major catastrophic ending to the relationship and I've been on no contact).

She feels bad and has apologized, but i thought it necessary to take a break. She says that she really wants to get back together, but one of her friends just told me that she said ""How funny would it be it I hooked up with (insert names of two of sauceman25's friends here)?""

808, Wife and I had an argument over me telling my wife that i was walking with a female co-worker at night. Wife thinks that it sounds fishy and suspicious and that it makes me out to be hiding something. Is she completely wrong and is,"My wife and I have been together for 2 years and had a major argument where im completely lost if i am being an asshole or right for keeping my stand.

I had a work event that ended around 10pm, myself and my coworkers were walking to a nearby subway station and I was walking next to a female co-worker and talking about work. One of my wife's friends walks by and i wave hello and we both continue walking. Now when i get home i tell my wife ""the event was good and that i ran into her friend while i was walking with Jane(female co-worker)"". 

After this point everything went to shit based on this one sentence. She starts asking me why did i have to mention that i am walking with Jane and tells me that my sentence gives her the impression that i am hiding something by telling her who i was walking with at 10pm at night. 

Now this went on for about 4 hours and i kept my stand at how my sentence had no intention of implying that i am hiding anything and that regardless of who i was walking with i would of said the same exact sentence guy or girl. But she thinks that since its a girl i told her so that when her friend tells her the next day she is prepared (which is true in hindsight) but honestly i could care less what her friends tell her. Basically she said i made an extra effort to tell my wife that i am walking with a girl and that it sounds fishy and suspicious.

Am i completely out of line and crazy for thinking that what i said was perfectly fine?! and that it shouldn't of led to a 4 hour argument ?

809, I feel disrespected after being ignored and ignored after being told to call back after hanging up on me and texting that she ran into someone important. What is the best way to handle the next time I talk to her and how to handle the current one,"This is more to vent than anything. 

Just an hour ago or so I was on the phone planning an evening with a young lady I have recently started seeing and she abruptly hung up on me without saying a single thing.  I thought the call just dropped so I called back and she ignored it, then texted saying ""she ran into someone important"" to which I replied ok call me back afterward. 

Still haven't heard back from her though I happened to notice she has been liking instagram photos of mutual friends. This really just put me off and i'm kind of pissed off. 

For a time I let my ex really get away with a lot of bullshit so I am hyper sensitive to this right now. Is it something about the type of girl I date that makes them be disrespectful or is it just that people my age have completely lost sight of how to treat someone??

further to that how do you think I should handle this when I next talk to the one i'm seeing? am I overreacting and should just let it slide? Or should I tell her I feel disrespected?... I am a really laid back person and it takes a lot for me to really be put off by someone so any advice is helpful.

I'm gonna be honest, I've never been in love with anyone before. I hate people. I really do. But she's different. She's the one person in this world I think I can be myself around. Really, she's everything to me. 
Anyways, I was on my tumblr today and I saw her post something about going to dinner with another guy. I know that she's had a crush on him for a long time (they're gamer friends). The rest of the post basically said that she said ""no"" to the dinner and now she's regretting doing so. She says that the guy doesn't have a romantic interest in her and she's struggling with that. 
Seeing this has made me feel super jealous. I can't feel anything but deep sadness right now. I love her with all my heart. That's NOT an easy thing for me to admit. 
I've communicated my feelings for her to her in the past. Basically, we've been playing the ""wait and see"" game. It's driving me bonkers. What's happening to me? I don't like feeling this way at all.

She is very supportive and a wonderful girlfriend for the most part,","I started dating her when I was 19. Let me start off by saying that although we've had a few breaks, it's been a happy relationship. She is very supportive and a wonderful girlfriend for the most part, but I'm contemplating ending it out of the curiosity to date other people.

With the exception of a few hookups during brief relationship ""breakups"", I haven't slept with more than a handful of other people.

That, coupled with the fact that I somewhat regularly find myself thinking that she isn't the ""most beautiful girl in the room"" (to me) because of her weight/shape/demeanor (i feel so bad for saying that though) really makes me curious about dating and sleeping with other people.

I regularly find myself in situations where i have the ability to sleep with other girls I find really attractive, but I would never want to make that move and cheat while I'm with her. Although, it does makes me feel like I'm missing out on opportunities.

On the other hand, she is honestly incredibly supportive and giving. She really believes in me as an artist and gives me strength. She helps me push my music career forward and always has unbounding love for what I do which is also so valuable to me. So much so that I may have become dependent on it.

This is usually the reason why I come back to her after I separate us.

There have also been people that have told me that she mothers me at times which can make us co-dependent.

I'm not sure what to do Reddit. Perhaps it's childish to keep her around for support and I should instead find that support within myself or other friends. Or maybe it's less smart to drop it with someone who will go the distance with you.

814, I feel like my current SO is unwilling to take risks and is unsure about us. He is unavailable for the next few weeks and I went out and made out with a friend on Saturday night. Should I tell my current SO about the make out session,"Throwaway:

Been seeing this wonderful man for about 2 months. We became exclusive about a month in, which is great. However, I was ready to take it to the next step and told him such and have been met with statements like ""I'm not sure"", ""I like you a lot, but I'm just not 100% committed"", ""I don't know yet if there is potential"". However, this contradicts how he acts around me and the long-term plans he has made with me like attending my father's wedding. Ultimately, he says he just needs more time to figure it out. Frankly, I think he is unwilling to take risks.

Anyways, I told him I understand and I'll give him some more time (mostly because his mind is stressed out with graduation coming up) however it has made me feel insecure about the potential of us. Prior to this conversation, I thought everything was progressing smoothly however he feels it has stayed the same and nothing has progressed, feeling wise. 

This leads into him telling me that he will be unavailable until 4/30 due to the pressures of schools and finals. So, Saturday night I went out to a show without him and met up with a friend. That friend and I ended up making out at the end of the night after several beers.

I'm not sure if I should tell my current SO. I feel like his unsure-ness about us makes me feel like he doesn't care about me or our future. I feel like he doesn't even care if I go around kissing other guys. I could be wrong but I don't think i'm willing to find out. I just wanted to hear what everyone else's take on this situation was.

I feel like this isn't the right major. My real passion is music. Given the choice, I'd happily be a music ed major. I'm going into earth sciences mainly so I can have a job that will support a family. Sure, I'm *interested* in earth sciences - especially the possibilities of researching alternative energy. It's nothing like my involvement with music though.

There are so many reasons I shouldn't do a music ed major though. The biggest one is money. I don't want to be paying off student loans in 10 or 20 years, struggling with a shitty-paying teaching job. I feel like that's what a music ed major is going to get me, though. It'd also require an extra year in school, which I don't know how I would pay for. I'm currently a freshman, and I believe the music major is a 4 year program, which I couldn't start till first semester next year.

I feel like the longer I put off making a decision the harder it'll be to switch majors, but there's no easy way to figure this out. It's the difference between what I want to do and what's more realistic to do.

How can I avoid it, and how can I move on after all this time?","Since I met my friend, Josh, 5 years ago I've had feelings for him. We dated for a little while, but he wanted to get back together with an ex so we broke up. I've been in a few relationships since then, but I've never stopped thinking about him romantically. I'm crazy about him, I've always wanted to be with him again.

We've both been single for a few months, and we've been hanging out more often than usual. We go to dinner, movies, just normal things. I thought I was maybe picking up on some flirting (he *always* tells me I'm pretty, touches me a lot, etc.) but he met another girl a few weeks ago and they've started dating.

Since meeting her, I've purposely avoided hanging out with him as much because it just hurts and because I want to respect her. Josh is genuinely a good friend, and we are very close; he knows me better than anyone, I can be very open with him (except about how I actually feel about him, unfortunately). 

Now, he talks about her all of the time- how much he likes her, what she's like, what they do, etc. He wants me to meet her, but I honestly don't want to. It would just make me too sad to see them together. We've both been in relationships since we dated, but I always thought we had an unspoken agreement to not formally introduce each other to the new significant other, so I've never actually met any of his girlfriends and he hasn't met any of my boyfriends.

Two questions. First, how can I keep avoiding meeting her? I know it's immature, but I know it would break my heart. Second, how can I make myself truly move on after all this time? I want to let go, but he's exactly the kind of person that I want to be with. It sucks and it's too hard to keep doing.

I would much rather spend $30 bucks for car insurance than $130.

Is this legally possible? Now I'm not planning on getting in an accident, I'm a safe driver, but if for some reason I get into an accident and it was my fault, can they go after my fathers assets?

Do I need to get the more expensive plan? I do not think I can afford the $130 a month, but I do not think a $100 difference is worth possibly losing/leaning a house over.

This is how it was from the start. During this course we went out few more times. Its all very good - nothing wrong at the surface. Healthy flirting and no one said ""I love you"" sort of thing yet. But we still go out on dates.  
  
But now the texts from her have become less and less frequent. I either get a reply to my text the next day or I do not get at all. I asked her what's wrong - she said she was just busy with her life.  
  
I really hate to entertain this thought but is she interested just because I take her to expensive outings etc?  
She works at the same place as before, I know she's online on chat but I don't get texts from her like earlier. I can't believe that she is so busy that she can't even text once during a day, forget about the multiple texts we exchanged earlier. Is there a sign - no interest etc?  
  
What should I do?  
- Go on more dates assuming she's really busy?  
- I accept that she ain't interested in me anymore?  
I like her though and once told her in passing as we were just getting started. She never ever told me so outright.

Here are some of the ones that I did at my previous place of work (in the first two instances, aided by friends).

1. Started a paperclip trading consortium. I'm really not sure how this got started, exactly, but by the time it ended, we had participation levels of around 75%, including some management. Basically, we used a lot of coloured paperclips and everyone had a preferred colour or colours, so we traded. And not just for other paperclips, either. I won more than one argument with the head revisor by offering her stripy paperclips.

2. I sewed a small black cloak, put it on a potato and left the potato on my friend's desk. Neither of us looked at it or mentioned it unless directly asked. She got to have most of the fun on that one, but it was incredibly amusing. People would come into her office, ask her a question then suddenly ask ""Is that a *potato*?!"" She just said yes and, if they asked for more information, added that it was the ""great potato"". No further explanation.  By the time it started going soft, we'd established a small potato cult in the office, complete with ""the faithful"" who brought the potato offerings of hair, glasses, and eyes, and the ""skeptics"" who refused to believe in its existence.

3. Drew a comic illustrating the phrase ""Colourless green ideas sleep furiously"" and posting it outside my cubicle. (OK, this one might be less odd than the others, but it was amusing to watch clients do double-takes.

It's a big problem. Our landlord is going to shit.  There is no way to stain/ treat the wood the way it is now. We can sand and restain it but it is damaged in a way that it will never be the same again.

My husband and I have said that we need some time to think about their consequences. We explained to her (8) that she is not stupid, nor is she a bad person but she made a very bad choice and needs to learn from it.

I'll never forget how much it hurt my scalp when she shampoo'd our hair because she would scratch her nails into our scalp when lathering our hair. It hurt BAD and never understood why she did that.

Fast forward 20+ years later (now, being 29 years old.) I've picked up her method ever since and have always cleaned my scalp just as hard while shampooing - essentially stimulating my scalp and cleaning the pores from which my hair comes from every time I shower, as I always have.

I look in the mirror the past two weeks and find that my hair is thinning out. Not too bad. But today was the straw that broke the camels back - a bald spot that I can barely hide by combing my other hair over it is becoming very noticeable. And Im able to pull out 2-3 strands of hair by just pinching with my thumb and pointing finger. Either something is really wrong with me inside and I'm really sick, or I'm starting to bald early. Mind you I have a lot of stress from work, I barely have time to exercise in my schedule and I recently quit smoking cigarettes after 5+ years.

I immediately Google hair loss for young men and read everything I possibly can. I'm so deep into my anxiety and grief at this point that I go straight to researching which Rogaine works best - just as a temporary fix if anything, because I can't stand knowing that I am losing hair this fast and this young, with this noticeable balding under my combed hair. 

I do further research, and I find out that I've been unknowingly wrecking my scalp the past few years. Not only have I been washing my hair WITHOUT conditioner..  I've been using Selsun Blue (medicated version that has menthol) EVERY. DAMN. SHOWER.. thinking I was doing my scalp and hair a favor by washing aggressively with what I thought would be the best/healthiest product for my hair.

I think that this situation has opened my eyes to the very real possibility that I","Basically my girlfriend has always needed to lean more on me than I have on her. Typically this is in the form of complaining about certain events in the day or worries/concerns about the future or past and family issues (her mom is narcissistic and puts her younger sister against her). She's more external than I am with her emotions and is a little insecure. I, on the other hand, am more withdrawn and can typically navigate through my own stuff. I haven't felt like she's understood me for a while now, but she argues why that's not true when I bring it up. This is how things have been for a while with us..

Last month my mom passed away from aggressive cancer in her kidney, liver, spinal fluid, and bone marrow. I was with her holding her hand when she passed away. Now obviously this experience has had a pretty big hold on me. During this time, our relationship's very structure has been flipped upside down in that I really need support and don't feel like my girlfriend understands me well enough to get the support I need. She's been resistant to give me space because she's ""not getting what she needs"" in the form of my time, attention, and affection. I think that this situation has opened my eyes to the very real possibility that I'm not getting what I need and I might not have been getting that for a long time.

I know I was rather short with the details, it's sort of hard to jot everything down right now. Do you guys think I can trust myself and my jump to that conclusion right now given my emotional state? Feel free to ask any questions if you have them. Thanks for reading.

But until once of us gets out... what should I be doing? I have been staying at some friends' places the last few nights or just coming back really late from work so he's already asleep.

But unless I'm out of that apartment 24/7, 'no contact' doesn't really work out since I'm still going in and out for various things and having to chat about logistics. 

Should I just be casual and normal with him til one of us is gone (I'm sure within 2 weeks), it seems like acting cold and distant yet still being present would be painful as well, I don't know if that would expedite his healing process by much.

We had the chat about making distance, and we did recognize that it would be hard to not see each other around anyway because we work in a very small industry. So to him, it was a bit absurd to change the trajectory of our lives around avoiding each other, since we'll have the same social groups. So while in this situation where we can't fully avoid each other anyway... how should I behave when I see him at home? Should I just convince him to agree on the no contact rule once we aren't living in the same spot?

I have a feeling I am being weak about this... avoiding my guilt by embracing friendliness rather than doing what's best. Is that so? Is it ok to act more or less normal when we see each other at home (still sleeping/living in separate rooms though!) or should it be like... really curt? Curt in the way that might hurt a little or emphasize the awkwardness? Am I even supposed to say 'hello'??

We ended it on a good note because we believed that we'd always find our way back to each other. I do believe that he is my soul mate, he is just an amazing person who I absolutely love and was also my best friend.

Soon after the break up I was introduced to another guy who I am now very close to. We had sex a month after my break up and have been FWB ever since. He wants to be in a relationship with me while I don't want to be in one with him. He's an amazing guy but I feel he's always on his phone, we're completely the opposite and he's very unaffectionate. I've met his family and he said they really like me etc. 

The problem I have is that I'm still in love with my ex. He knows I had sex with someone else and got angry about it. I went out drinking with the new guy and some friends last night, my ex wishes me happy birthday and my drunk self wants to meet up and talk. I don't remember what happened but I left new guy for ex (nothing happened) and stormed off cant remember why though. New guy got hurt that I left him, I explained that I just wanted to talk and I was drunk but nothing happened. 

I know that I'll always have strong feelings for my ex and I can't move on from him. I feel too emotionally involved with the new guy to just tag him along and drop him. Yet I feel like I'm not emotionally attached to him. He said he's falling in love with me. I can't break his heart.

Quick summary:
Ive liked this girl since we met 6 months ago. She is really cute and we have so much in common. When i met her she was having trouble with a guy who she thought she might go out with. She didnt.  Shortly after that she had an almost friends with benefits relationship with a guy, however he thought it was more and that caused a fair bit of drama . I cant tell whether she wants to get back with him or not, i just thought that if she wanted to move on it wouldnt take a month like it has. Inbetween these to guys we kissed one night at a party.
Asked her out after this having known her a month and she said she liked me but wanted to try a relationship with guy 2 instead.
Whist she was in the this 'relationship' we became really close friends

The other night:
Before going out with a group of our friends she asked me to stay with her because her 'ex' was in the group and she didnt really want to spend time with them. I agreed because they arent really my close friends and i knew other people out.
Most of the night she wanted me next to her and she kept holding my hand and stuff. I vaguely also remember a point where we were about to kiss but i could tell that if i did she wouldve got upset, even though it was her doing most of it. Then as we all went back to a friends house to stay the night in his living room her ex slept next to her and seemed like he was pretending like nothing had stopped between them acting really friendly even though she said she hated him (they werent alone in the room and nothing happened however).

I grew up on a small island (about nine thousand people within 30 square miles) in a very tight knit community. Many of the people I graduated high school with also attended school with me every year from pre-school onwards. In 2009, my friend took his own life in his dorm room. It was incredible shock to everyone around him, he had been studying musical composition happily for two years at a school he loved. We've postulated that this unmeditated was probably a result of some traumatic brain injury sustained previously. 

Anyways, two months after he passed, a concert was organized to showcase his talent and as a way to get together the people who loved him from back home and at his school. The concert was in an [intimate and beautiful concert hall] and lasted about 45 minutes. I had heard all of these compositions previously, but only electronically. I'm fairly certain there wasn't a single dry eye in the house. The final piece of the evening was played by Xian Gao, who is a professor at the school and a violin virtuoso if I've ever heard one. He came on stage and humbly spoke a few words of loss and love, and mentioned that tonight was his birthday, but that he could think of no greater honor than playing in remembrance of our friend. I've honestly got tears running down my face writing this writing about it, but I've never been so moved before. It was more than just a reflection of his life, he was *in* the music. Unfortunately, I've lost several friends and family since I graduated high school, but *never* have I felt so close to them after they'd died. It was like sitting in a room speaking with him, but so much more intense. I can only liken it to what music feels like while tripping on mushrooms, only a hundredfold strong. I wish I could share some of the compositions with you, but there isn't proper copyright on them yet.

All the hours were written down by the employees on a sign in sheet each day. Two pay periods in a row I got the sign in sheets out, went over them, added my hours together, and found they didn't match the hours listed on my pay stubs. There was 11 hours missing total, 5 from one and 6 from the next; the equivalent of about 86 dollars before taxes.  

Sunday the boss came in and started barking at me that the crab tanks were only partially cleaned. So, I braved up and told him what was bothering me. I said that there was 5 hours missing off one pay check and 6 missing off the next. I told him that I felt very discouraged about my job and that if I could have a guarantee that the hours would be repaid I would have no problem working harder at scrubbing the tanks. He said that he would have to review my hours before he could guarantee that they would be paid back and that I did not have the right to work less even if I felt like something was going wrong. To which I replied that I understood that but I did the math and found it quite distracting that with my hours being cut I was technically only making 6.50/hour which is under minimum wage and illegal. At this point he said I was being threatening and confrontational and that he was clocking me out and it was time to go home. 

All of this seem very illegal to me. Even if an employee is doing a sub par job by your standards I am pretty certain it is illegal to pay them below minimum wage. On top of that it seems pretty shifty to be cutting 5 hours off of each paycheck. And lastly, are you allowed to just completely fire someone?

844, Boyfriend keeps asking if I want to try anal sex. I've told him no and he keeps asking. How do I tell him to stop and get him to drop it? If I ever change my mind I would say something but I don,"We've tried it 2 or 3 times, I don't like it because it's too painful and I'm just not interested in it. I've told him this countless times but a couple months will go by and he'll ask again if I want to try it. 

I don't know how many more times and how many more ways I can tell him no. I feel like a broken record at this point. It's like he's got a fetish (which he denies as I have asked). How do I tell him NO and get him to drop it? If I ever change my mind I would say something but I don't want to tell him that of course or he will get his hopes up.

845," Mom had depression, came home yelling and screaming, didn't hit us, but made us shit our pants with fright, now she is better, but I still feel scared when she is around, and I don't know why.","Okay, first for some background, My mother, who had some kind of depression from 2003 - 2015, would come home 
yelling and screaming most days, if she left the house.

She wouldn't be like that all of the time, but she had a hair trigger and got upset over everything under the sun. If my brothers and I needed help with a bit of homework, she would try and help us but got mad when we did not understand, and we were home schooled. 

With the home schooling and the hair trigger/lack of patients, my brothers (15 and 19 now) and I fell really far behind 
In our education.

In june this year, she went to the doctor who diagnosed this depression and gave her medication to fix the hormone imbalance that caused it, and right away there was a huge, night and day like difference.
It has been a few months and I still feel terrified when she pulls into the driveway or walks around upstairs.

The rational side of me knows that she isnt going to hurt me, she has never really hit me or my brothers, just made us shit our pants with fright.(metaphorically)

We were on the swim team at our local ymca, and did alot of other stuff as kids and she never went ape-shit in public, but i wouldn't say that we had a good relationship.

Will I alway have that feeling of dread?

846," I have a guy in my life who I can't stand, but because of the way he acts towards me, nobody else would believe it. How do I deal with him? Do I put him in his place?

And for the most part I get along well with people and make lot's of friends. But there's this one guy who kinda is ingrained in my circle friends who I can't stand! I thought after high school I'd never have to deal with him again but now my one and only close friend has been hanging with him alot, and therefore I have to see this massive prick. Everytime I'm around him I try to give him a chance, and everytime he's justbas bad if not worse. He does little things like picks up on one insecurity of mine and harps on it, tries to give me advice on things he assumes I need in an insulting way, he'll call me out on stupid jokes I make and make me feel jusy generally inferior. Last night I was at a party with him which was fine at first until he started the dick waving contest he always does and even began trying to choke me out. I was about to knock him the fuck out. The problem is because what he does is so subtle and directed towards me, nobody else would believe that he's the biggest asshole of a generation. He puts on a nice guy persona for everyone else, and I feel if I did decide to maybe insult him back or punch his stupid face everyone I know would think that it's uncalled for, and I'd be pretty much a pariah psycho to them. So I guess I'm wondering how do I deal with him? Do I put him in his place? Do I continue to ignore him?

847," I want to move back to NJ, but my bf and I have a lease in LA for another year. I feel like I made a mistake and I don't know if I should keep going with the lease or if I should go home.","To start off, there is nothing inherently wrong with LA. I just don't like it and I don't feel this is the city for me. Let me rephrase, I like LA, but I don't love it. 

My bf got offered a job in LA that he couldn't pass up. I followed him to LA a few months after he settled in, and after much convincing from family and friends. I left my job in NYC, friends and family to come here and I am aching to go home. 

We have a nice, cozy apartment. I also find LA to be just as expensive as NYC after my boyfriend convinced me that it's a much cheaper city. I finally got a job offer but I'm taking a pay cut from my last job and I had a really hard time landing this job. 

I know I haven't given it enough time, but I really want to go home to NJ. My mom lives alone (she's widowed) and I would love to just start over. Am I being hasty? Our lease is up in September 2016. 

Maybe it's something deeper. I am just really unhappy and I cry a lot. I self medicate by drinking wine every night. I don't want to leave my apartment because I don't like driving around here and I don't want to lose my parking spot. I thought LA would be an adventure and it's not what I'm looking for.

I don't want to lose him, but I don't feel that this is satisfying as a relationship","Started dating this guy awhile ago. It started off just as a hookup, but he decided to ""keep me around"". He was in the area for the summer (goes to a university about a couple of hours away). Second week into it he started assuming we were exclusive. I hadn't been exclusive in awhile, but I agreed to it since it seemed to mean a lot to him and I liked him. Then he starts throwing around the word ""girlfriend"" without having actually asked me out. Now, this guy kept joking that he's going to break up with me once school starts. It doesn't really bother me at first, but as we spent more time together, it really starts to hit a sore spot. I tell him I'd rather have a casual thing, but he's not up for that, saying he's too insecure. He finally actually asked me to be his girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and now he's back at school. He's pretty distant and doesn't seem to be into the whole boyfriend routine. I'm lucky to hear from him during the weekday (mostly see him weekends) and it's hard to have meaningful conversations with him. Honestly, I'd much rather just be fwb, but ever time I try to broach the subject, he gets upset and shuts down. I've stopped trying, but I just don't feel that this is satisfying as a relationship. I don't want to lose him, because he's fun to hang out with and the sex is pretty good, but I'm worried he won't want to see me anymore if I break up with him.

Background: My boyfriend and I have been together for five years now, we are both in our twenties and live together. I think we have a great sex life, more sex would be great but we are both busy. We have never sexted or sent each other nude photos.

Over the last couple months our sex life has come to a screaming halt. We have only had sex twice. A lot of this is due to our busy schedules and me struggling with personal issues. 

So today: I thought I was spice things up. I asked him when he would be home from work (his schedule varies) and he quickly responded. So I sent a nude pic (though nothing actually showing) and said to hurry home. It has been two hours and absolute silence. 

Should I be concerned? I feel paranoid that I offended him or something. Is it irrational for me to feel hurt by his lack of response?

850," Dad is obese, refuses to lose weight, eats junk food, has no exercise routine, has sleep apnea, and has no motivation to lose weight. What can I do to get him to lose weight and get him to take his health seriously?","My dad has been obese my entire life (I'm 24yo). Throughout my life he has never openly admitted his weight problem (he is about 400-450 lbs), and has never taken an initiative to work on it. He is the only overweight person in our family, and he has no other condition causing it -- just his food intake and lack of exercise. 

Due to some other circumstances, I've temporarily moved back in with him (parents split about 3 years ago), and I'm watching him eat junk food, refuse to go on walks with me, and never leave the house. He works from home on his computer and the most exercise he gets is walking from his bedroom to his office. 

I am doing the grocery shopping while living here, and every week he puts on the list cookies, ice cream, and pies, and then puts it back on the list the next week. He's the only one who eats it. I have tried not buying them, and I get yelled at and then he will go out of his way to do the shopping himself and buy all the snacks. I have tried getting the fat-free varieties and also got yelled at. When he does go out he will stop at McDonalds and order off the dollar menu because he is very frugal despite admitting he makes enough money to live luxuriously. 

I bought him a Misfit Flash tracker for Christmas and encouraged him to keep track of his food intake through MyFitnessPal, and his exercise via the tracker. He also has sleep apnea issues as a result of his weight, and I told him he can track his sleep as well. Of course, he doesn't use any of it, and only wears it when I bring it up. 

We are lucky enough he has not yet suffered a heart attack but it's only a matter of time, and I don't want to see my father die early when it is very preventable.

853," Boyfriend of two years has never told me about his long-term girlfriend (whom he lost his virginity to, said ""I love you to"" first, etc.) until pretty far into our relationship. He is very evasive about the whole","My boyfriend and I have been dating for two or so years. We are both 22. Everything in the relationship's great, except his avoidance of the ex-girlfriend topic. Now don't get me wrong, I feel as though most people are that way about their exes, which is fine. The problem here is he never told me about his long-term girlfriend (whom he lost his virginity to, said ""I love you to"" first, etc.) before me, until pretty far into our relationship. I was upset about this because of the fact that we had had tons of unprotected sex before he told me. In fact, whenever the topic of his ex-girlfriend comes up, he is very evasive about it. He told me specifically that he never was actually in love with her and that I was his first love. From what I've heard, their relationship did not end well. It sounds like he kind of feels a bit bad about it in a way; like he feels sorry for her. 

I think every time he's talked about their relationship it's about how badly he still feels about it. I recently ""stumbled"" across some of his facebook messages (I know, I know. It's bad) which included a conversation with her; nothing major, just them planning to meet up. He has never mentioned them meeting up before, when he told me that he would just briefly let me know if he was going to hang out with another girl (not by my request, but his own). Also, not sure if this is important or not, but from what it sounds like (mostly me inferring, as he is very evasive about it) they had a fantastic sex life that we just don't have together and he feels badly about that as well. This issue has started to make me somewhat insecure about things. Not sure if it's a legit concern or if I'm just being silly.

So the question here is, guys, what is he thinking here and why the avoidance? Is this just normal guy behavior that I shouldn't be concerned about? Or should I actually confront him about it? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I was jealous of my friends who had a live-in playmate and someone to talk to. My mum was a single parent and spent most of her time either at work or on her computer. I used to play Monopoly by myself and pretend to be someone different for each of the 'players'.

My brother was born when I was 12. I was ecstatic - finally I was getting the sibling I had always wanted and I adored that baby. By that time, however, I was old enough that instead of being an older sibling I ended up more like a second parent. Initially this was fine, I enjoyed looking after him because I had always liked babies and it was fun to see him develop.

As we got older, I was left looking after him more often. I looked after him every day after school all through my teenage years while mum was at work. I couldn't go anywhere, I couldn't stay at a friend's, I couldn't make any plans for after school because I had to get home to my brother. I wanted to be a teenager and do normal teenage things, but instead I was stuck at home looking after someone who shouldn't have been my responsibility. I resented him for that.

It made me depressed and angry, and destroyed any chance of building a loving relationship between him and I. He's 11 now and I know nothing about him. I only ever see him when I visit mum, and even then we don't talk. I still see myself as an only child, and him as one too. We didn't grow up together as siblings, we grew up as caregiver and child.

I'd love to build a relationship with him, because I feel horrible when I think about the way I treated him. The way I took my anger out on him and never showed him any love. But I'm pretty sure he that's all he remembers about me, and he won't understand why it was that way.

First thing you should know about me is that I am a student with 2 and half years before I graduate from medical school, and so I will have zero income until then. Second thing you should know is that the government has granted me more student loans than I actually need, which is a significant reason that I have $40,000 in my bank account in the first place. They usually grant me with around $20,000 each year ($1000 of it is pardoned), whereas my school fees cost $12,000 a year. I am also extremely lucky that my parents have been kind enough to provide room, board and food for me throughout my entire education. I will have to begin paying off my loans in September 2016, at which point I will be owing approximately $104,000 in total (accrued from both my undergraduate and medical studies).

The problem is that I am completely clueless when it comes to investments. Something tells me that I shouldn't just let this money stagnate for the next 2 and a half years. Would you guys be able to offer some advice on what I should be doing to make the most out of it at this moment in time? Should I be putting it into mutual funds, stocks, or what not?

865," I wrote POOP and PISS on a website for my girlfriend to present at school, she asked me what it was, I told her it was just HTML 5 and CSS 3 and she got pissed off and hit me in the head with a book","Hello, this is my first TIFU here and I know it's not the best but here we go!

So my girlfriend recently transfered to a new school and she is trying to fit in with the new class mates and teachers.
Her IT teacher asks if anyone is interested in composing a team to build and present a web site at the nation wide IT contest. The contest starts regional and goes national and has multiple categories (web design, web apps, programming, multimedia, etc.)

She has no knowledge and asks me (a programmer) to help her out with it and teach her a few things.

---

I make a website and give her some basic knowledge on how everything works, she is happy I am happy.

I build the website in a day and show it off, it works ok, not much to talk about.

I have 3 placeholder buttons, one is a to google, the other two have POOP and PISS written on them.

Well, she copies the website's directory folder to her flash drive and goes to school, I too go to school.

She calls me up 1 hour before the end of my class we talk a little, she is all cool but wants to talk (ok?).

---
I go home and she tells me that she presented the website today and asked me what kind of silly stuff I wrote on the website.

My answer: Just HTML 5 and CSS 3 honey...why?
GF: Think again...
Me: *the think machine un-jams* OW SHIT! I FORGOT I SWEAR I FORGOT

866, Girlfriend broke up with me and went to her friends apartment after work. She says nothing happened but I don't trust guys around her. She still hangs out with the guy and I'm not sure how to cope with her being friends with him.,"My girlfriend got really upset one day and broke up with me. We resolved it Sunday she was just freaking out about all the changes in her life. 

She broke up with me on Tuesday and we talked and I thought we resolved it to taking a break not breaking up. We were going to try to work it out. 

We were talking about stuff and then she said she was going to her friend Kaylas for the night. So I let her go. The next day we went to lunch to talk and she reaked of alcohol. I asked her how much she drank and she said enough to not remember the night. 

I don't like that she drinks but it was fine she was with her best friend Kayla. 

Sunday comes and she says she needs to talk to me. I go over and she is bawling and said ""I didn't actually go to Kaylas Wednesday. I went to Ryans.""

He is 19 and lives in an apartment by himself. They worked that night together and asked her to come over to talk because she was upset. She went over and they talked and before drinking told him nothing was going to happen. Then she drank who knows how much but she doesn't remember anything after that. He swears to her nothing happened. That he slept on the couch etc. 

I trust her saying she didn't want anything to happen and he is just a friend. Except he has told her before he has feelings for her. 

She told me even if I did do something with him we were broken up so it's not cheating. That makes me kind of fishy. 
We talked about it and I'm pretty certain nothing happened but I can't help feel betrayed by her and hatred for him. I don't trust guys around her very much because they all try something on her. 

Am I in the wrong to be upset even though we were broken up? I have forgiven her and if if happens again I'm gone. But how do I cope with her still being friends with him. She talks to him all the time and I can't help but feel jealous and hatred.

867," Boyfriend says I hurt his feelings when I said things that were insensitive. How do I handle the situation and how can I make him feel better about the whole thing?
TL;DR: Boyfriend says I hurt his feelings when I said things","Lately my boyfriend has been sensitive and I don't know how to handle it. Lemme start off by saying I have no issue with him being sensitive, however I have been the cause of the sensitivity which makes me uneasy. 

The instances: 1. When he was explaining something about me when we first met, I said it was a little weird (he creeped on me a little, but in the end I don't care anymore) 2. He likes to say he itches himself and I said ""You scratch yourself not itch yourself (jokingly). He then became distant in conversation after I said these things and brought them up later saying I hurt his feelings. Both nights became awkward even after I apologized. 

My apologies were sincere as I don't mean to offend him in anyway. However, I don't really understand how what I said were insensitive things to say? He says he hasn't been mentally there this week due to smoking less nicotine, eating better, and working out more. How do I go about taking to him/handling the situation?

868," I have a hard time getting over my ex, even after months of college and years of being apart. Seeing her again makes me feel like I'm going through the breakup all over again. What can I do to get over her and not feel so","We broke up for college last year and I know I had a rough time, going from constantly seeing a best friend to not even communicating. It was an understandably mutual decision as we were both going forward in life, but it still hurt a lot.

Anyways after a few months of college, I thought I was done with her. Then she began drunk texting me quite often. I was civil at first then ignored them as I realized it was just hurting me and going nowhere. So I got over her again.

Now that we're back for summer, she's been wanting to hang out with mutual friends as we were all close. I thought I was at peace and had gotten over her but just seeing her again ruined my day. I felt (and still feel) like I'm going through the breakup all over again. 

Avoiding her is out of the question since my best friends are close friends of hers as well. We were all one big happy family and now there's this awkward rift between my ex and I that is stemming from my confused feelings and was damn near palpable to my friends when we all got together today.

Also, I would never want to leave my friends, especially because of her.

869," I want to forgive my friend who cockblocked me, but I don't want to lose all my friends because of it, and I don't want to lose Kim because of it. What do?","This girl, let's call her Kim, was with me last year, but I was basically forced to break up with her because her dad wouldn't let her see me and it killed me and I couldn't take it any more.

After about half a year, *right when I start to have feelings for her again*, I find out she's going out with one of my closest (at the time) friends[16M]. to make it even worse, before I started having feelings for her again, **I specifically asked said friend,** let's call him Jimmy, **if he was into her**, cos I wouldn't want to cockblock if my mate is into the same girl, y'know. Jimmy said no, and that i needed to move on. Asshat.

At first I was on an emotional rollercoaster, but then I was prepraed to forgive Jimmy, cos I really looked up to and respected the guy, for doing this to me. I talked to him, and **he made it clear that he didn't even want to be friends with me!** This guy had been one of my friends that I could rely on, confide in, and he *didn't even want to be friends* this whole time?!?

Any thought of forgiveness had just rocketed out the window, and I was MAD. Took me a good month to get over the girl, Kim.

Anyway, Jimmy and I have pretty much all the same friends so when our group are together its like a rubber band with two positive magnets on it. We just don't make eye contact. This really upsets me because as a Christian I desperately want to make up with him, I really like the guy...

Do you guys think I should try to be on good terms with Kim and Jimmy (Pardon the 8Mile references), or should I distance myself from them so they don't hurt me further?

870," fiancé is looking at pictures of trashy girls on IG, some of them are his exes and girls he has slept with. Not sure if I should tell him or ask him to stop.","I have been with my fiancé for four years, I have always known his previous/usual tastes were slutty, trashy looking girls and I thought being a girl from a good family with a degree I had broken the mold. One of his exes was on the reality show ""For the Love of Ray J"" to give you an example. 

To cut to the chase, lately I have been walking by and happened to see him on Instagram looking at pictures of trashy girls, some of them it's not even pictures of their faces in it just straight up ass shots. Gross. This happened multiple times over the past month. When he saw that I caught him, he scrolled up fast to make it look like he was reading text, so he's obviously hiding it. I have an IG, but I don't even follow any guys let alone guys who post sexy shirtless pictures. 

My issue is this... I am one of those girls that is fine with pornography, I actually watch it myself. But some of these trashy girls he follows are his exgirlfriends and girls he has slept with too. Some are also known prostitutes. It just feels different. But telling him or asking to stop doing it seems strange and I'm not even sure if he would, kinda like kids and porn he's just going to look behind my back.

871, I moved to a new city and got clean off cocaine. Came back to the old city for Christmas party and partook again. Now I feel hopeless about my new life and future. Anyone else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I work in financial services (think investment). I'm a young, high achiever. I recently moved to one of the top firms following a 2 month 'holiday' where I left my old town and got clean off cocaine.

Business in my old town ran on coke, absolutely everyone was doing it, and I was doing it daily. It was very hard to come off of it but I went home to my home town and spent some time with friends and family and got clean.

I moved to my new posting about 2 weeks ago and all was going well. Until the Christmas Party. After I was already quite boozed up someone brought out a bunch of coke. Everyone was doing it and I stupidly partook. 

When I am on cocaine I don't behave like me at all. Long story short I was a mess and went home with one of the VPs. 

Now I'm mortified and feel totally hopeless not only about my new company (which was meant to represent a fresh start for me), but about the future and also about facing work after this.

Has anyone been through anything similar? I am an idiot and don't know how to deal with this.

872, I'm afraid that my girlfriend is missing out on part of life by not being able to party with her friends and I'm afraid that she may not love me as much as I love her. What should I do?,"So I've been dating this girl M for a little over 8 months, and I dont know if I'm overreacting or not. Things had been going really well (We had are disagreements sure, but nothing that I would consider major) when she came over and said that she was having doubts about our relationship. She said that when she is out with her friends that sometimes she wishes she was single so she could do whatever at the parties that she goes to. Further compounding the issue is that she really doesn't want me going to any parties with her because she thinks that I'd would ruin them by breathing down her neck, despite me telling her otherwise.

She swears that she loves me still and doesn't want to hurt me, but she is afraid that she is missing out on part of her life by having a serious relationship when practically none of her friends have one. I believe that she does love me, but I'm also afraid that I'm just setting myself up to be hurt.

I really do love this girl. I've been in much longer relationships than this one and I cant recall ever feeling this way about a girl prior to her. What should I do? My approach has been to let her do what she wants  because I trust her. I also know that alcohol can make people do things that they never thought the would do. I don't know that I could just break up with her to be honest, but I just want some help trying to figure this out.

TL;DR: Husband is lying to me about his family,","We've been married for almost 7 months. Even while we were dating, his family has been a constant source of drama and conflict. We even went to couples counseling before we got married and the advice we were given was that we needed to establish boundaries between his family and our relationship.

Lately he has been lying to me about things related to his family. When they all try to make plans about things, he never tells me what's going on and I only hear the final plan once it has been decided (and then I'm the bitch because I can never attend because no one has asked me what my schedule is like). He even lied to me about his student loans, which I only discovered because I made him pull a credit report and the numbers did not match the information he had given me. And then I saw in his texts that he told his mother 'I'm telling her X, if she asks you for some reason, back me up.' 

Last night things came to a head, when his mother sent out an email scheduling an event saying ""after many back and forth emails."" I had not been included on any of these back and forth emails, and my husband swore he was also excluded from the conversation. I picked up his phone, went through his texts, and found the text his mom sen him in the hours before her email, saying ""I'm sending you a separate email to discuss scheduling."" He STILL denies lying to me, saying that what I saw wasn't what I thought, and he shouldn't have to defend himself to me. AND he's mad that I betrayed his trust and looked at his phone.

874," Girlfriend broke up with me, texted me after 3 weeks of not talking, said she still cares for me and wants to know how I am doing, but has no feelings for me. What is going on here?","If you are wondering about what happened, here is a link to my previous post about the actual break up 

In simple terms, after my girlfriend of over a year told me that she lost all romantic feelings for me and all feelings towards me altogether, I was distraught. It has now been almost three weeks since we officially broke up and up until a week ago, I was repeatedly trying to contact her. When she finally told me that she just no longer loves me, I realized that I had to stop, so I did.

I did not text her or call her for a few days until this weekend when she texted me telling me that she hopes I am having a wonderful weekend. I didn't answer her because I honestly just didn't know what to reply. She hurt me and texting me telling me that she hopes I am having a good weekend seems condescending in my opinion.

Last night she texted me again, this time around three in the morning which leads me to believe that she was awake because she was thinking about me. She told me that she still cares for me and wants to know how I am doing, but still has no feelings for me. Once again I am unsure of what to reply, so I have not yet answered.

I cannot tell whether she geniunely wants to see how I am doing or if this is something else. If it is the former, then that is rather selfish on her part. I do not want to be her friend, I want to be her boyfriend obviously. I still love her despite it almost being three weeks and I am still getting over it. I can't imagine just ever being friends with her and I do not think that what she is doing is right. I was just beginning to get better until she decided to step back into my life. My question is, what is happening here? Thank you.

My step mother and father have been living together for around seventeen years now and they are a happy couple. I'll just jump right into it.

My step mother has been very secretive with phone calls recently. Once, I answered her cell phone to tell the person (Was just a phone number, no ID or contact info) that she would be right there. She ran out from where ever she was and snatched the phone out of my hands and hung up as fast as she could. I didn't really question it. But she is always on our deck alone when my father is taking a shower or watching TV etc. while she does whatever she does on her phone.

Today, I lost my phone in my room somewhere so I borrowed her phone to call it. I accidentally clicked her messages instead of the call button at first, and there was a message from again, just a phone number. I don't remember it exactly, but it had something along the lines of ""hey baby ur so sexy i love u to death""

I don't really know what to say about it to be honest. I want to approach her about this but I have no idea how to. I've also copied down the phone number to call this mystery person on my own time, but I have no idea how to get them to tell me who they are on the phone. I obviously cannot come out and say that I am her stepson.

So I've been seeing this girl for maybe two to three weeks. Been on maybe three or four dates with her. Last one we had, we ended up in bed together, which for me is pretty fast. I was a little weirded out by it but was not overly concerned. I figured it was just one of those things.

I sms'ed her the next day about something or other, she replied amicably. I didn't think anything was wrong. Then we didn't have any contact for about three days (over the weekend). Today I had this email waiting for me:

""I take it from the lack of communication that you don't want anything to do with me any more. If I'm wrong, great. But I doubt it.

I really thought you were better than this. I suggest that next time you just want to use someone for a one-off fuck, grow up and be up-front about it from the start. And if you lose interest, get over being a spineless creep and say you're not interested any more, instead of just going silent. Or maybe you just get a kick out of playing games with people's feelings (so this email will be a bonus, do enjoy the thrill of knowing you've upset me). Clearly you're just another devious play-acting cunt-rag.""

I've tried calling her, emailing her, she doesn't respond. I suspect she's blocked my number and spammed my email address.

I really like(d) this girl, and I feel really bad. I know it's like Relationship 101 to call someone after you sleep with them, but I was actually genuinely busy and hadn't got round to it. Our relationship up to that point had been very casual. I fully intended to see her again. I didn't actually want to sleep with her, and I definitely wasn't trying to ditch her after I'd 'got what I wanted'. Am I wrong? Is she maybe a little bit irrational? How should I proceed?

I've been going out with a girl for about a year on and off. When we started going out I wasn't keen at all, but she kept texting me and inviting me round to her place and one night we had sex after a night at the pub. We got on reasonably well as friends but we had nothing in common. I think we were both lonely and were just keeping each other company. Anyway as time went on I discovered she was a borderline alcoholic, which made me split up with her several times. But she took counseling, promised to sort it out and said she loved me. I don't love her. She's very messy, forgetful and dirty, has no interests, doesn't look after herself, but she's caring and generous. I can't stand her taste in clothes, furniture, music or art. I kept bouncing back to her, until recently when I just had enough and left her for good. Now she's ringing me in tears saying I've been cruel and heartless, that her life is a mess (it is), that I'm all she's got (not true, she's got many friends). She's wailing down the phone. She cries about all these other things wrong with her life, and all these reasons why her life's so bad (never her fault, always someone else). I just want to be left alone and get on with my life (I don't want to be in a relationship atm). On the other hand I feel sorry for her and feel like I should help her, even though somehow I know I can't.

I also feel like I haven't balanced my debts, like I will still owe them something, or that my brother-in-law or sister-in-law will grumble, ""Why are you still paying for OP's portion for ________""?

They sometimes pick up other small things, like lunches and dinners, that I have done with less frequency, because we have family things at their houses most of the time.

TL;DR: I got caught sneaking","So about 3 weeks ago I got caught trying to sneak over to my girlfriend's house when her parents weren't home. I'll admit, I wanted to have sex (we've done it twice before) and just have some alone time together with her for a while. We live about 45 minutes away from each other and neither of us have our licence so we usually depend on our friends, or our parents to take us from house to house

Any way long story short we got caught. She got grounded for a month and I got grounded till ""I don't know when"". I'm missing a lot of things because of this and I don't know when It's going to stop. 

We had a Mardi gras balle (Yes, I live in Louisiana) at school two weeks after and my girlfriend got court! She was allowed to attend and I was not. Come to find out she got voted queen but I still felt terrible because she had to go without a date because of my actions. 

Now it's valentines day and I made her an awesome present she won't get to see on valentines day because I am forbidden to see her at all. Not to mention I got my phone taken away so now I have no way to talk to her at all! I feel like I disappointed her and it's killing me inside.

886," I have no experience with girls, but after months of hard work I feel confident and happy, but not sure if I should ask a girl out now or after improving myself a bit more. If I do it now, how does that work and what","**Info about me**: For the first time in my life I actually feel happy and confident, the only problem is that sometimes I feel lonely. I have never had any experience with girls, I was always that shy, withdrawn kid. My flirting skills don't exist. However, after months of hard work I've improved my social skills, have a bunch of friends, I traveled quite a bit, and have some interesting hobbies, I just still suck with girls because I have no idea what I'm doing.
This summer I plan to learn picking up skills, learn how to flirt and so on. I'm going to cold approach some girls, I have even saved up money for a bootcamp. So this shit is going to happen, finally !

So there's this cute cool girl in my class. We've met at the beginning of classes, in October last year. We aren't too close, but during that time we've had a couple of interesting conversations, and sometimes we talk and I think she occasionally playfully teases me or something (like, telling me how she hates me and then smilling?). So I guess we are like 2 friends acquaintances/friends from a class but not too close.

A few weeks ago after that improvement in my life I realized I kinda liked her I would like to meet her outside uni, spend some time with her and do something fun. The problem is, like I said, I have literally 0 experience with that stuff. So I played with that idea of asking her out a little bit, then I decided yeah let's do it and now I have doubts so I came here.
Should I ask her out **now**, or learn how to flirt, travel, improve myself a little bit more and then **after summer** do it ?

How does one ask a girl out anyways? And what the heck would I do if she accepted the invitation.

Somehow, when she's on top, she can just rub herself against me whilst I'm inside her and achieve orgasm, but it's not from me being inside, so she says. 
I can also achieve the same result if being fast enough during missionary and putting enough pressure on her clitoris.

Now I've set on a quest to get her to reach that point as I'm sure it's possible and there cannot be such a thing as a girl who cannot achieve vaginal orgasm. So, i've been googling on the subject and reading all sorts of stuff about how the G spot doesn't exist and there is no such thing as vaginal orgasms, and now I'm just sitting here in front of my screen thinking "" well then, what is going on here ?

We got closer really quickly and long story short, she knows all my friends, my parents and extended family, texts my mom every now and then just to have a laugh, etc. (we don't live together though). Problem is, I don't think I love her anymore. I guess feelings can (and did) fade away eventually. But now the problem is bi-dimensional: first off, we've been saying « I love you » and stuff like that on a very regular basis. If I don't say it regularly she'd ask why, and then I wouldn't have much to explain except that I don't mean it anymore, and she would probably feel devastated. What's wrong with that, right? It's a breakup after all, even if I would have a hard time justifying the « I love you » of the past months (I'll take any tip), and neither her, nor my mom, or my friends, would understand at first? But the other dimension of the problem is that she's going through rough times at the moment (not exactly her, but her sister is in a deep depression and her father just got fired), and even if I don't feel any passion anymore, I would never ever want her to be sad, feel hurt, or anything like that. How can I be true to her, in saying that I don't see a future for us, as well as making it as easy as possible for her to go through that? Should I wait for better times?

Our car was parked in the spot parallel to and just behind the gate, along where the sliding gate backs up while being opened. We were getting in the car as another car was exiting the lot and triggered the automatic sensor to open the gate. Just as the gate was sliding next to our car, the breeze blew open our driver's door far enough open for the back of the opening gate to catch the inside of our door, pull it open further than it is supposed to, and slightly twist it before stopping. After 15 minutes of figuring out how to close the gate stuck against our door we inspected the damage. The door can barely close and lock, but since it's twisted the top half is open to rain and coat hangars while the bottom half is pushed in further than it should.

I'm currently enlisted in the Military and have a top secret security clearance. My father retired down in Panama (The Country, not the city in Florida). This makes it VERY difficult to leave the country due to entering paperwork, going through training and explaining my reasoning to my superior officers.

My father constantly tells me that I should be putting more effort into seeing him, despite the difficulty for me.

He's made several trips to the US to visit friends and familiy NOT in my area, as well as for work, but has made only 1 attempt to come see me in Virginia and I had warned him that there was a chance I would be out to sea during that time frame. Turns out, I would be out to sea during that time frame.

Well, he just recently announced to me that he is now taking a trip to Europe. He said he had been saving for it for a while now (I've never even heard of this being mentioned before).

I'm completely at a loss on how to react to all of this, but I'm rather upset that he couldn't bother saving that money to see me now that I am in a situation where I will not be out to sea for quite some time due to my ship being drydocked.

How do I build a new life for myself?","My husband and I have been together for 10 years. We moved to another country 8 months ago for his job. I have been trying to get my visa sorted out and it is still not approved. Because I have been on a tourist visa I am unable to work. I have no job, no savings, no money in my bank account. I also have no friends in this country because I do not speak the native language. 

My husband has decided to leave me because I am infertile. We found out I was infertile 4 years ago when I was trying to get pregnant and could not. He said he was ok with not having kids. Now he has changed his mind.

He is at work right now and said he would like me to move out as soon as possible. I don't know what to do. I am estranged from my family and don't think I can go back to my home town and stay with them. I have reached out to the family member I was closest to but still have not gotten a response. I also reached out to the friend I knew best before we moved overseas but she did not consider me a good friend and is not willing to help me.

I am looking at flights right now because I can put that on a credit card. But other than my home country I have no particular destination. I have no way to support myself until I find a job. I am alone and scared. How do I build a new life for myself?

908, I met my current gf on an online dating website and she has a history of being cheated on and being left for other girls. She shields her phone from me seeing it and talks about her latest ex in great detail. Is there a chance that,"I met my current gf of about 3 weeks on an online dating website. About 2 days later we meet up at my place, hook up, have a good time etc. The day after we decide to make it a mutual relationship with each other as exclusive.

I am concerned however about some possible red flags that are coming up often and repeatedly. She always wants me to express my feelings about her and I always say that I like her and I want her to be my gf. However, she always brings up being afraid of being cheated on, left for some other girl and not wanting to waste her time.

Now I wouldnt be so concerned about this usually as we are a new couple and all and trust isn't fully formed as that takes a bit of time. However, when we were together at her place I reached for my vaporizer and she was on her phone. she immediately shields her phone from me seeing it. I thought it was really odd and she seemed upset afterwards. I kept asking her whats wrong and if shes ok a few times and she would not tell me why she was acting that way. I left it alone and brought it up the next day. She said she was talking to a guy she had ""a long story with"" and she eventually told me he kept ditching her or whatever and she had given him money a few times to come see her. I was like ok, tried to explain that he probably doesn't care about her in that way and moved on.

She also continuously browses dating websites still even when I am around her. And has on more than a few occasions talked about her latest ex in great detail and on one occasion called me by his name accidentally.

Now is this some sort of insecurity/self esteem issues or are these truly red flags? or am i just being some sort of insecure/jealous asshole?

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

So I was in the cafeteria with a few friends and I thought it would be funny to screw with them a bit with the salt-shakers. So I started off by filling one of my friend's pockets with salt while she was speaking to one half of the group, the other half trying to contain their laughter, as they were focused on my prank. She puts her hand in her pocket at some point, hilarity ensues, blah blah blah. So, continuing the theme, I thought it would be funny to pour a bit of salt on another one of my friend's phones as she had unsuspectingly left it on the table, followed up by moderately funny salt puns and playfully mocking her about how crunchy her keys would be. Again, harmless, stupid fun, easily amused friends amused easily.

Later in the day, she texts me ""So you pouring salt in my phone cause the speaker to break"". Fuck. So, of course I immediately tell her that I will pay for it's repair, but she tells me it would be cheaper to just replace it.

Repair fee-$100
Upgrade-$200
Luckily she was nice enough to let me off with $50 (although, to be fair, I know a bit about hardware and I could have easily fixed it--I didn't want to come off as rude or stingy, however, so I just obliged to pay). I ended up paying her 60 because I only had 20s and I didn't ask for change as I figured I owed her a bit more than that.

I pointed out that he was married, to which he said ""I get bored."" 

I told him that I wouldn't rat him out to his wife as long as he kept his distance and left me the hell alone. 

I went to work the next day, and vented to my coworkers about it. A lot of us had attended high school and knew the family as well. Turns out, this dude has gotten with more than a few girls my age. This dude has been stepping out on his wife for quite a while, and I feel like shit for telling him that I wouldn't say anything.

It's a sad day for me, and I feel bad for everyone","This is more of a venting of sad emotions b/c I have another 2 1/2 at work, than looking for advice. Consolation, maybe. Also, this is a major struggle for me to write now.

I've spent a fair portion of my day checking Facebook on and off, which is naturally covered in Happy Mother's Day things (I even posted one of my own in memory). I also went out to brunch with my boyfriend and saw plenty of happy families enjoying todays specials at XYZ restaurant, as well as at work. But it's finally hit me, and I can't take too much more of it, because I don't have a mother to call up and praise or thank in a way that I know would be understood. (I'm also 5hrs away from where I grew up/where she's buried so leaving flowers on her headstone isn't really an option.)
 
My mom died 2 weeks after my 20th birthday. It will have been 4yrs ago in a couple of days, and my grandmother only 16 months and 3 days after her. I was close to them both and I miss them so much every day. I wish I could call them, catch them up on my life, introduce them to my boyfriend, get their opinion on the state of my career just to hear their support, cry to them about stupid work issues, anything and everything. 

Fewer things make me angrier than when I hear someone bad mouthing their mom (when its not an abusive relationship, mind you) because somethings not going their way, or Mom's not reacting to something in the way they were expecting and are losing their cool. I'm angry at them because I'm jealous of what they still have that I lost- each other's company- and I so desperately wish I could have just one more conversation with her, that their snipping is showing how much they undervalue just that much.

Basically I told her I was a virgin and she seemed okay with it and said we could take it slow or whatever. I don't really want to take it slow, I just want to have a normal adult relationship.

Then I actually got the courage to be naked around her, but my dick didn't work. We tried for like 5 days but nope, nothing. We would still mess and I genuinely tried to just ignore what was happening with me and focus on her but after a couple of days I could tell it was starting to get to her.

And she's been pulling the fade now and I've got the feeling it's already over so I've just stopped making contact. I just hope she doesn't tell anyone I know that I'm a virgin, or have a small dick that doesn't even work, or that I'm a complete failure at adult relationships in general. She probably deserved way better anyways though.

I don't really know where to go from here. She came onto me so it isn't like I'm just gonna meet someone new, I've been trying for fuck knows how long with zero success. I'm really tired of being alone and it makes me sad. At least I'm no longer a 23 year old virgin, I'm now a 24 year old virgin.

TL;DR: Wife had affair, we've tried counseling, but marriage feels stale and I fantasize","A little over a year ago I discovered that my wife had been having a months long affair.

During the time that she was sleeping with another man, her and I rarely had sex ourselves. She explained to me that this was due to a loss of libido and eventually started to see a sex-therapist over it.

It turns out she was seeing the therapist in order to figure out what she wanted...me or the guy on the side/divorce. I eventually discovered the affair (Had my suspicions and snooped on her phone).

Not much of an argument occurred, but she was obviously sorry and upset. I was hurt and pissed. At the time she was a stay-at-home mom to our infant son. I told her to leave and go to her parents while I sorted things out. After several days I was even more miserable...I missed our son... and even her little bit. We went to counseling and ""worked things out.""

Today, many, many month later, what I thought was a marriage on the mend has turned stale. We rarely have sex (Despite my consistent come-ons and attempts to make her life around the house easier.)...just like when she was cheating...as a result I am constantly suspicious. She claims she is not cheating, and really has given me no reason to suspect her, despite the lack of sex. However, our marriage has started to feel more like roommates. I love her a lot, but more in a ""caring way"" and not the ""I can't imagine my life with out you!"" way. And as a result, I often fantasize about a life without her. 

I guess I'm just curious if there are others out there in a similar spot. I don't know if it's the rarity of sex, or the fact that I can forgive her cheating but not forget, or what, but I m feeling anxious and don't know what to do next.

My credit score in in the 680 range, I know that doesn't mean a whole lot in terms of loan approvals but I'm sure they take in some consideration.  

Am I really too much of a risk for $15k?  I'm a little bummed out about this.  Should I try another credit union to seek approval?  I know my credit takes a small hit when doing this so I don't want to waste my time and credit trying multiple places looking for approval if I'm going to get the same answer.

928," I bought a house in 2007, after the market crashed we have been trying to sell it since then, but after the market crashed again we have no options but to get foreclosed on. We have been waiting for Wells Fargo to approve the short sale","I'll try to keep this short. My wife and I Bought the house in 2007 at the time it was valued ~135,000, we bought it for 126,900 at 6.25%. We have been wanting to move for the last 4 years but after 2008 we have of course been underwater. Last year I spent most of the year trying to sell the house as it looked like the market was improving a little. 

What I didn't know is houses in my particular subdivision were slowly being bought out and turned into rentals. This combined with foreclosures made it so FHA will no longer approve loans for the neighborhood. At this point after talking to multiple people it became clear my only real options were to do a short sale or get foreclosed on myself. (If anyone has any other suggestions or paths please say so)

We have been waiting for Wells Fargo to approve the short sale since December. Our finances are draining monthly, even if we could afford it we no longer want to live here as it doesn't feel safe anymore. We have had the house broken into and things stolen, as well as a car stolen out of the driveway, packages taken, mail tampered with, dog poop smeared on the side of our truck... the house is valued at 75,000 now, we still owe 107,000.

We go to different schools and live about 30 mins away from each other.

We've gone on a few dates. I hug her before and after each date. We haven't held hands or kissed yet but I want to. Obviously she likes me since she asked her sister to set her up with me. She is waiting for me to ask her to prom and has asked her sister frequently about how I plan to do it (her sister knows since she is friends with my older sister, who I have told the plan to). I'm asking her to prom this week on our next date with this super clever ""activity"" of which she has no clue.

Anyways, I want to kiss her this date and hold her hand. It's gonna be about a 1 hour date and 1 hour drive time together. I'm sure that my cleverness will blow her mind.

930," Friend broke up with her ex, is considering getting back together with her previous ex, and is conflicted on how to handle the situation. What do?
TL;DR: Friend broke up with her ex, is considering getting back together with her previous","My friend doesn't post on reddit, so I offered to post on her behalf.

She broke up with with her ex (let's call him Bob) about four months ago, they had been dating for six months. While they were dating, she was still good friends with her previous ex (let's call him Joe) that she had dated for about three years. Bob and Joe were on friendly terms, and Joe had a new gf and all of them even went on some double dates.

She broke up with Bob about four months ago and he took it hard, and while they've remained on friendly terms, she's tried to create some distance between them. Meanwhile she's continued to spend time with Joe who has been a good friend all along, and who by this time had also become single again. However in the last couple of weeks she and Joe decided that they wanted to give things another shot and get back together.

The problem is that there's some overlapping social circles between everyone and essentially Bob, Joe and her are all going to be at an upcoming party.

She is really struggling with the question of whether and how she should let Bob know ahead of time that her and Joe have gotten back together?

My advice to her: most definitely. What do you guys think?

Next, how should she break the news to Bob?

My advice to her: send him a text or a message, like a head's up kind of thing, short and sweet. In all likelihood he will reply and try to engage her, but I think she should ignore any of his attempts to do so.

She thought maybe she should have a conversation with Bob to let him know, but I think that's a bad idea because he will probably make it all drawn out (he can be a bit needy emotionally). It's probably going to be shitty news for him, but I don't think she should feel responsible for him or how he deals with his feelings. She feels bad for him, but I don't think she should make it her problem and I don't think that she owes him a crap ton of emotional support to help him through this. What do you guys think?

We have been married for 9 years and have 2 (wonderful) kids together.  Over the last 2 years, life became more difficult between us after throwing 2 kids into the mix.  I long suspected that she was cheating on me after our son was born 2 years ago, but one day we were on the way back from a trip to her parents place when she told me that she was leaving me and that she wanted a divorce.  Being shocked at this sudden revelation, I tried everything to get back together with her for my sanity and the kids' sake, but to not avail.  She moved in right away with another guy, so I know it must have been brewing for a while, but she left me to deal with a mortgage, tons of credit card debt accrued during her many stints without employment and shopaholic rage spending, 2 kids and all their needs thrown in and now lawyer fees.  I just got a notice that they are going to garnish my wages for a hospital bill that she got and never paid since I am the only person with a job right now. It also turns out that she was fired recently for ""lewd activity"" with one of her boyfriends while she was on the job.  Is there anything I can do?  My life is turned upside-down and as I am trying to get back on my feet for my kids, I get blindsided by her craziness and lack of responsibility.  Have any of you gone through this sort of mess?

Can I tell her to stop having contact with the new guy and remove him off facebook, or is it unreasonable to ask her to do that because we aren't technically","My ex and I split up after being together for around nine months and good friends for a year before. It was a rocky relationship with some very good parts and some very bad parts. After being away from each other for two weeks, we're both going to try and get back together.

Except in this time she met a new guy at work, who has been flirting with her heavily for two weeks, calling her 'Stunning' and 'Gorgeous' and messaging her every day. She got a lift home with him during this time and he tried to hold her hand, where she apparently told him no and that she just got out of a relationship. She didn't tell me about any of this during the two weeks we were apart and said she wasn't flirting back, but there may have been some ""innuendos"" at points. In our early relationship history she had a history of flirting with other men when we were fighting or bad, and rarely being truthful about it. That improved to a certain extent.

My question is, can I tell her to stop speaking to this guy? To remove him off facebook and say she doesn't want to speak anymore? Am I being overly controlling or I am justified because we shouldn't be starting a relationship together when she has another man on the side lines like that?

938, I was with my ex for 7 months and it was my first serious relationship. I'm with my current boyfriend now and I'm curious if anyone else still thinks about their ex sometimes. Anyone else out there who has had a similar experience?,"I'll try to keep this short. It's been over three since things ended with my ex. I've been with my current boyfriend (m/22) for about 2.5 years and everything is really awesome! So this isn't an issue of going back to my ex or whatever but I was just wondering if anyone else out there still thinks about their ex sometimes even after so long. 

Background story. I was a senior in high school when it started and a first year in college when we ended things. The relationship lasted around 7/8 months and it was my first serious, ""I love you,"" kind of relationship. The way things ended were very dramatically and traumatically. I made stupid decisions and was naively led into thinking that being with him was wonderful and it was cool to have someone so much older like me (yes, stupid I know). My family life has been really horrible for many years; both parents are very emotionally and physically abusive so I clung to him for the attention and support. The only other person I had was my sister (she and I have always been extremely close) and she saved me from wanting to kill myself when my parents attacked me after finding out about the guy and forcing me to end it with him.

I guess my question is, does anyone still think about their exs sometimes? I know that I don't love him anymore and wouldn't ever consider getting together with him even if I were single or whatever but I think the experience was so ingrained in my head that it lingers on. I'm guessing it'll eventually stop coming to my head but yeah... any experience?

If you need to know more, ask in the comments and I will tell you what I can.","I have been with my girlfriend for about 6 months now, and for the first several months of our relationship, everything seemed to be going perfectly. But as it turns out, she has been depressed for longer than she can remember and just did a really good job hiding it until she trusted me enough to let me know about it.

I am the only one she had ever told about it and she keeps it hidden from her parents because they are one of the biggest causes of her problems. They make her feel like she isn't good enough and don't listen to her with her problems and the whole situation is a mess.

With my encouragement, she sought out counseling at her college (we go to school about 5 1/2 hours away from one another). They recognized it as severe clinical depression on the first visit and she had been on antidepressants for a month now. None of them have helped, except Sertraline, which helped until she started breaking out in a rash that the nurses were afraid was a reaction to the medicine.
 
Since getting help, she's had a lot of bad days and I can usually calm her down enough to not do anything drastic but sometimes I couldn't, and about a week ago she self-harmed for the first time, making small cuts on her upper thigh. I know this is a very bad sign.

I'm worried she is going to hurt herself and I think she should go to the hospital to get straightened out but she never will because it would cause her parents to find out, as she is on their insurance.

I really don't want her to hurt herself and I will not hesitate to call someone to show up to her place and make her go to the hospital if she is in serious trouble.

My question is: Who do I call in case something happens? On a weekend the counselors office she goes to isn't open so I can't call them. Additionally, I know she lives on her college campus but I don't know exactly what her dorm is called or what room number she's in.

Her father, though, has always been odd and reluctant to talk to me let alone include me in what they do. This may just be a fatherly defense mechanism, so it should be taken with a healthy dose of my favorite seasoning.

Recently, my IG account was set to open. She liked a photo, which was a good sign. That's all, though. About 2 weeks later, I grew a pair and followed her. Since then, she hasn't responded in any way. It should be noted I tried making my profile private, as an attempt to try to draw her in. So far this has been unsuccessful, and instead of paying attention to me, someone she somewhat knows, she follows douchbags. Along with that, I've developed friendships with a few of her female friends, and I didn't experience any reluctance.

She did this during winter break as well, both times I have been upset and thus made her extremely sad, making me feel like a shitty son. Not only that, but I now have to ask off work, when I am currently in the running for a promotion. I love her but she doesn't get it. Am I right to be mad?

948," Hubby and I have a lot on our plates, but we still have a pretty healthy sex life. He wants me to wake up with him at 4am so we can have sex (or at least oral) before he goes to work. I","So. When we first started dating, my hubby and I were disgusting animals who just humped for like, days at a time. Then we got married and had kids, who are now 2 & 4. We currently live with his mom, which definitely puts a serious damper on the romance. My husband is working 60+ hours a week right now as well, and has to be at work at 5am every day. I am a full-time student, up at 6am every day with the kids who I do pretty much everything for, as well as all meal prep and cleaning (his mom doesn't really clean or cook unless it's a holiday).

I mean, just like adults everywhere, we have a lot on our plates right now. It sucks. We are tired. I fall asleep on the couch by 9pm many nights. The relationship with his mom is tense at best, and we are planning to move into our own place within the next 3mo. 

All things considered, I think our sex life is still pretty healthy. There have been dry spells in the past (especially postpartum). We have (great) sex 2-5 times every week. Even when I'm on my period, he still gets BJs. He gets frustrated because we only have sex at night, but I'm like.... when the hell else are we supposed to do it?!?! He wants me to start waking up with him at 4am so we can have sex (or at least oral) before he goes to work. I am so not into that idea, and he has called me a dick multiple times for rejecting his advances in the mornings. He initiates more than I do, but I still make a conscious effort to be the initiator at least once a week (it's been a complaint in the past). I have been making more efforts to be physically loving and adoring as well, to make him feel more appreciated without the need for sex constantly. I've tried telling him that this is as good as it gets, that we have two young kids AND we live with his mom who has no sense of privacy, personal space, or boundaries. So what to do?

949," Boyfriend and I got into a fight about homework, and now I don't want to marry him because of it. What do I do? Is there any chance of getting back to normal after a fight like this, or is there no chance of","A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I got in a very weird fight about something completely stupid: I'm taking a grad course that he took awhile ago, and I was doing my homework but didn't want to ask him for help because I wanted to do it on my own, and didn't want to do it at that moment; he got really pissed and told me I needed to give him the homework problem and do it right that instant, and I told him absolutely not. 

The fight got really, really ugly, and I ended up having a nasty panic attack in the middle of it. 

We are very close, and have been talking a lot about getting married in the future. However, during the fight he said that if I wanted to be his wife, I needed to grow up and stop being immature (about the homework thing). 

This has completely changed the way I view our relationship, and, though I am still very much in love with him, something in my head has clicked and I no longer have a desire to marry him. I'm appalled that he would have used the fact that he knew I wanted to marry him against me in a fight, and I really can't get over it. 

I'm not sure what to do in this situation. Ideally I would like to not be upset about this, and go back to feeling the way I did before the fight. I hope I am not being petty. I know a lot of nasty stuff is said in fights that is not meant.

TL;DR: Neighbors just got out of prison, has been acting suspicious,","Call me paranoid, but I think my neighbor is going to try and break in my house. Here is a little back story: I don't live in the best part of town, and my neighbors family (wife and 2 adult sons) have been making a living off of selling drugs while he was in prison. Well the dude just got out about a month ago, and been acting really suspicious the last 3 weeks or so. It all started when they got news they were going to be evicted. Every time I leave my house/come home he watches. and he waits for outside me any time I leave and comes and talks to me as soon as I get out of my car. That's where the suspicious questions come in. He will ask me: ""Where do you work at, What's their hours, what shift do you work?"" He has also asked to come into my house on several occasions for various reasons. (to use the phone, internet, ect.) I can only assume that he want's to case out my house. Now, my house has some CCTV security cameras installed and a DVR to record the video. I've had them installed for about 3 years now, and he has been in the state pen for only 14 months. He just recently asked how many cameras I have and if they are operational. That sounds like a huge red flag to me. You would think cameras are all I need as far as a deterrent, but he is still watching my every move. And on top of that, the DVR isn't internet capable, and if someone was to simply take the it, I would have no video evidence of the break in. I have several firearms and I'm not afraid to use them to protect myself, but I think he knows this and is waiting to strike while I am away at work. I'm getting so nervous (or paranoid, depending who you talk to) that I'm having trouble sleeping at night. What should I do?

951," I have a large dog who jumps at people when they come up to us, but not when we are walking. He is very food motivated, so training is a good idea, but I don't know how to train the ""sit"" behavior.","Hello all! My dog Reggie is a large (85 pound) mutt, mostly boxer/pit/etc. He loves human attention - his favorite thing is to sit on top of someone on the couch (whether he's just met them or known them for years). This is rarely a problem because I hang out with dog people, but meeting new people can sometimes be a pain. 

When someone starts walking up to us and Reggie notices, he starts to pull towards them. I allow this if I know them (perhaps my first problem? Except he is large and usually without harness because he doesn't pull on walks.) Then I await the coming storm - he has about ONE jump in him during the greeting. It is not to put his paws up on a person, the way I've seen other dogs, but really to try to sniff/lick their face. Unfortunately, this means there's a huge dog jumping up at people's faces like a missile. I'm writing this because today, a woman trying to give me a brochure came out of nowhere and handed paper to me, then he jumped up and, since I had him on a short leash, he kind of crashed on his bum in the snow. 

Current training: When we are at home and a friend is coming over, I DO try to train this behavior away by holding his collar, then giving my friend a treat and asking them to tell him to sit. He's extremely food motivated, so this works well. When the initial excitement is over, he does not jump as much for attention.

Final note: if someone makes prolonged, friendly eye contact, he sometimes get excited enough that he tries to jump for the face. I know this well enough that I'll break his attention before, but unfortunately my peers don't understand that staring isn't the way to keep a dog calm...

955, I met a woman in Copenhagen who congratulated me for the strength of my opinions and then took her bike and went her merry way. I want to know who she was and why she said that to me.,"Ok, backgroud story. I'm an Italian student that this summer went on a 10 day trip around europe. We visited Amsterdam, Copenaghen and Munchen...but this is not the point. 

While we were in Copenaghen, something quite unexplainable happened to me. I and two friend of mine were waiting outside a supermarket controlling our backpacks while two other friends were inside buying food for everyone. Mind you, we are Italians in Denmark, we were travelling by ourselves and we didn't knew anyone there. I was talking to my friend about nothing in particoular (how to properly put things inside a big backpack, if I remember), when we saw this woman.

 She was probably around 35/40 years old, was wearing worn out clothes and was riding this old bicycle with lots of shopping bags full of empty plastic bottles (later we learned that some homeless people search plastic bottles in the dumpsters to take them to recicle points were they are given money for it). We, obviously, didn't bother...until she went near us. We were quite puzzled, but she didn't seem dangerous so we weren't worried. Then, she approached me, leaned toward me (I was sitting on the sidewalk) and in perfect italian wispered to my ear ""Allow me to congratulate you for the willfulness and strenght of your opinions"" (""Le faccio i complimenti per la caparbietà e solidità delle sue opinioni"", if some fellow italian has a better translation please tell me!).

 What. The. Fuck. I looked at her, mumbled ""thank you"" and then she took her bike and went her merrily way without giving me an explanation. I don't know who she was, why she speaked perfectly italian and most of all I don't know if that phrase has some deeper meaning. This happened the 10th of August; today, I had an illumination: why don't I ask Reddit, that most of the times has an explanation for anithing? This is my last chance to solve this mistery.

958," I saw a group of children walking with adults, and I wonder if anyone else looks at such a sight with just as much curiosity.

I took notice of this, and I wonder if anyone else looks at such a sight with just as much curiosity. I didn't know whether or not to judge the adults, but in the end, I felt it was probably safer for the children, but I'm not really sure why it is safer. I suppose it prevents one of them from running off, leaving the adults in a sticky situation - should I leave these other children behind and race after that child so he/she does not get hurt? Also imagine if 2 or more of the children started running in different directions. How does an adult manage that? 

Reddit, do you think children should be put on leashes? What do you think society thinks of it? I feel society feels like it is abnormal to see such a sight, maybe even cruel, but in the end, I personally think it is best for the children and the adults. Children are not predictable and can do something scary like run off into the middle of the street, and when you are with other children you cannot abandon them to go chase down that other child.

I think children leashes have a bad reputation, and I'm not sure if I'd ever use one,but if they were more acceptable, it would make me feel a lot more comfortable knowing that if I had more than one child with me and I was responsible for their care, that none of them would be running off leaving me in a terrible, split second decision making situation that could end up badly.

He does this every 2-5 seconds for long periods of time, and sometimes not at all for a few minutes (he's constantly inconsistent but keeps doing it) and can make the noise over 50 times an hour. I know this because it's so distracting to me that I counted, and lost track after 20 minutes nonstop. It seems like a it's a tic or something.

I have never talked to this person as I thought he was initially sitting at the desk of a person who has not been at the desk since I've joined the company, since all the time people will sometimes borrow laptop stations for a quick charge, or people's chairs for nearby meeting rooms if they're empty. He kept sitting there and by the third day he had his own nameplate at the cube, so by then I had heard the noise and realized he was here to stay.

In order to combat the noise I have brought in earbuds to pop in and listen to music and such while he's around, but sometimes he gets loud enough that I can still hear him, or I have to turn my music up too high for my comfort. I don't know what the other coworkers in my area think of him but he has become my nemesis; he even told a friend he moved to this desk to ""escape the noise"" of his last area ಠ_ಠ

He suggests this may be a simple short-lived infatuation she has, or any number of other explanations. I know this girl fucking likes me and I feel she does NOT want to have these feelings towards her friend. He suggested I do not break up with her on this tumblr post alone. He made a good point and it made me question what I want to do.

While I do think we are still honeymooning a bit, I do see a real future with her.  She requires quite a bit of attention, but I honestly think that is best for me: I like to be in that role.  My girlfriend and I have a BDSM dynamic, and she sees me in a Daddy Dom role.  I love taking care of her, it literally gets me off.

Recently my siblings both became engaged and frankly I am enamored with the idea of marriage.  I catch myself grazing my thumb against my ring finger, imagining what a wedding band would feel like.  Whenever I'm studying for a crucial exam, I get motivated by imagining myself being able to provide for my girlfriend-now-wife and children.  When we are having sex, I imagine her as my housewife (note, she knows about this fantasy).

All these behaviors sound harmless and possibly constructive for me, but I fear this fixation might bloom into something inappropriate.  As much as I would like to, getting married young tends to be a bad idea for many reasons.  I have actually discussed the idea of marriage with her (although not seriously, we just talk about everything).  She is excited by the idea too.  We have both acknowledged we probably will not be the same people in five years that we are today.  I want to be financially secure before I settle into a life with someone, and that's not going to happen for quite some time.  It's just a terrible idea to plan marriage at this point, but I can't stop thinking about it.

Does anyone else have experience with their SO opening up about something bad that happened in past relationships? How exactly am I supposed to react now that I have this knowledge? Sorry if I seem clueless but I feel so bad about it. And how am I supposed to be okay with seeing this girl around school?

A couple months ago I found myself talking to a girl who is a camwhore on a website. she tells me she's never done it and wants to give me a free show. I respectfully decline cause I have a girlfriend but i continue talking to this camwhore cause I'm honestly curious what her life is like in that buisness. I am nothing but proffesional with her. one day I end up letting her text me. But since then all she does is text me asking me to come watch her. I've bitched her out for this a few times. two nights ago she texted me and started a normal convo then said ""so...you wanna have some fun? ;)"" and I said no thanks. then yesterday I find out that My girlfriend went through my texts and saw that last exchange and wants to talk to me when she gets off of work in 3 hours. I have no idea what to tell her cause I highly doubt she will buy this. what should I say???

She still lives with her dad, and he doesn't care when she has girls over because he doesn't know her sexuality, so she can have a gaggle of women over at any time. She has also said she's kissed some girls that she's had over in the past. I still see kissing as cheating.

My only friends currently are girls, because I'm sort of feminine myself I guess. My girlfriend gets jealous when she sees somebody talk to me or give me their phone number. So if I wanted to have somebody come over to my place, she would likely get suspicious. I'd probably be dumped if I had another girl spend the night, even without sexual intent. Am I wrong in having women stay the night when she also has women stay the night? It feels like the same thing to me, but I'm new to this non-hetero stuff, so I am unsure.

969," I want to make clothing, and I want to use the word ""THUNDER"" as a company name. Can I do that, and if so, can a company with the same name co-exist with another company, which has the same","I have recently started some research about establishing a small company. I'd like to produce apparel. I was wondering if two companies with the same name co-exist. When I am talking about company name, I do not mean a company's name in paper, but rather what I can embroider on my products. 

1.  For example,can  a company, which makes clothing co-exists with another company, while both companies have the same name.

2. A company (one) which produces apparel which does not compare to the other company (two).  one produces bags, gloves, jackets. two produces  summer items such as shirts, polos, and shorts.

To my knowledge the company that was created first, and is financially strong can claim a dispute with the new company that has been established. What is the name was the same, but logos different? Would it matter? When I mean company name, I do not mean a holding company, but rather what is embroidered into the products. 

  This is a vague example, but can I embroider the name ""THUNDER"" and picture : just as how polo embroiders their player and horse with name. Furthermore another company has the word ""THUNDER"" embroidered, but with a different picture. Can I legally do that? 

There is quite a difference between polo and polo assn. The horse, the players and the name. Although it does somewhat relate to what I am facing. ""POLO"" is in both shirts, but both are for different companies.

When my brother was 11, she got me. She never got a real job since the birth of my brother, apart from voluntary work at my brother's kindergarden, as she loves kids. In fact, she didn't want to work, she wanted to be a housewife, care for me and my brother as well as possible, and there is nothing wrong with that at all! 

Now, I graduated in June and now I'll start university in October. I'm moving out of my parents' house and into an apartment about 1 hour away from my parents, I'm planing on coming home every other weekend or so, though. The main problem is that she doesn't have any hobbies, almost no friends and no job. My mom basically made it her mission in life to care for me. My dad works during the week until 6 and on the weekends they usually stay home and do nothing. 

Naturally, she can't deal with me moving out. She gets really upset when I decline her offers e.g. to pick me up from places where I normally walk home from, and she's constantly texting me when I'm not home. Recently my parents were on vacation, she still couldn't stop sending me messages asking what I had for dinner, what I am doing and stuff like that. It's getting worse and worse. 

I'm feeling extremely uncomfortable, as I can't wait to move out and be independent. When I kindly tell her to stop caring too much about me, she gets extremely upset. I have no idea what to do. I can't deal with her being so clingy and I'm sure it will get so much worse once I'm not living at home anymore.

We got outside and I didnt really make a move but after a long hung we both sort of just went for a kiss and ended up making out, anyway since then a few things happened in her life, she was ill and her close friend ended up losing somebody etc, Ive been very understanding offering my support just as you should, one other time we hung out we sort of had a small heart to heart I told her about my ex and everything ive been dealing with and shes sorry ive been having to deal with that.
I saw her out last night and we just generally chatted a little bit but she left because her and her friends were tired, I wanted to say to her face but because she left I couldnt so instead of just text her saying I thank her for being there to listen to me talk about my ex because its been hard and she said its fine shes everybodys vent at the moment, I went onto say thats not exactly what I meant I said that she actually cares and shes fantastic and its hard to find in people these days.
She went onto say that this is why she avoids ruining things, when I questioned her about that she simply said, she has commitment issues, so many of her friendships have been ruined from getting close, so she panics.
Im just not sure where to go from her, shes the first person ive actually felt attracted to since my ex girlfriend, I think she does like me shes just afraid to make that next step incase it messes up another good friendship, any advice would be great!

This is the first relationship I've ever been in and to be honest i didn't know what the hell i was doing. In short I would do stupid shit like bring up stuff from our past (when she was distrustful to me, she is very trustful now) and it would end up like making us both sad (ya i know im an idiot).

More about me and her, I live with my parents and I'm still in 3rd year of University and she has already graduated and lives by herself and has a stable job (which stresses her out all the time). 

As of last week, she came out and said that it might be better for us to breakup and I begged and pleaded that she give me another chance to see that I can change (which she did). 

That conversation was a serious wake up call I've been changing my attitude and I'm becoming overall a nicer person (I believe). We had a intense conversation yesterday where she aired her fears and concerns, she mentioned that it's to big of her to ask me to change my personality  for her , and shes afraid I would hurt her by reverting to my old ways (emotionally, I've never physically hurt her ever). For the record, I would go through this change regardless if I was with her or not for the better of me.

What can I do to save this relationship with this girl that I love so much, and when I say I'm changing I'm really changing and I've told her that.

So I met this wonderfully nice guy online. We talked for weeks (both online and phone calls) before deciding to finally meet. Our first date was pretty casual, we both had a drink at a blues bistro and ended the night with a hug. He even called me as soon as we got home and we talked for even longer. We were so excited about the date that we agreed to meet up again the following night. He's busy with an intense program at the moment, so he could only meet up for a couple of hours. He asked to come over which I was excited about. So he does and it starts off great, I make us tea, we talk. We then start to cuddle and that's when things get weird. We spoke the night before about how he wanted to kiss me and that I noticed but I wanted to wait until next time. So as we were cuddling I gradually kept making more and more moves initiating a kiss but he was so frigid and distant. I kept asking if everything was alright and whether I had overstepped and boundaries and he kept saying no. So when we finally kissed it was as if I had forced him into it, so much so that now I was uncomfortable for him. So I backed off and asked again if he was ok and he mentioned not wanting things to go to where they were headed (sex) which I had no intention of. But I guess the cuddling and kiss were too much for him. That night was two days ago and I haven't heard from him since (odd for him since he used to text me everyday). I'm just wondering whether to give him space and let him come talk it out whenever he's ready or confront him about it as soon as possible?

Her personality is great for him and I honestly think she may have a little crush on him and I know he finds her attractive.

For no good reason. I never used to feel this way about her but now all of a sudden I do even though she's really cool. I feel bad about having negative feelings for her, out of jealousy I guess. It makes me feel really bad.

Any tips on how to handle the time we have left and how to,"So, a co-worker of mine (30F) and I (28 M) have gotten very close over the last few years at work.  It's obvious we both have developed feelings for each other but the problem is that she is married (for 2 years) and constantly hints to me that she isn't happy with how things have turned out.  It's incredibly annoying since if she wasn't married we would definitely be dating and I don't know what she expects me to say in these situations.  I'm not the kind of person who would ever help someone commit infidelity, but the problem is, it seems like wants me to.  

For example, both of us went to a work conference in another city together and she asked me if we could stay in the same hotel room.  I found it really strange but didn't want to make things weird between us so I just said, ""Yeah, that's fine"".  Obviously, nothing happened when we stayed together since it would've been a disaster to sleep with someone who I work with and it would've wrecked my conscience, considering she's married.  There have been so many examples of similar things happening and it's getting to the point where I'm trying to avoid her now.

Luckily, she'll be leaving this job in 3 months and I probably won't see her again, but it's tough because I really like her and haven't met someone who I've clicked with so well.

I have a vivid memory of sitting in a sex ed class where the instructor started it off by saying ""I don't care what any of you think but you will all have sex one day"" to which my internal reaction was serious doubt.

I ended up going off to college with this mentality, and it was horrible for me. I didn't end up 'Forever Alone' in fact quite the opposite. I was so concerned that I would be 'Forever Alone' that I started treating women like objects instead of people, and attempted to 'acquire' them. I collected a string of girlfriends, all of whom were bad for me. But instead of realizing this I felt validated by the fact that I could get a girlfriend at all. Later when there was societal pressure to have one night stands with girls I wasn't attracted to I once again bought into my fear of being 'Forever Alone' and slept with them.

In essence, because I was afraid that I would be 'Forever Alone' I hurt myself to make sure that I wouldn't be. I've learned a lot along the way but I went through some pretty miserable years.

She describes them as always attacking her, leaving her with wounds all over her body and causing her a lot of pain.

I came home today to find her with her neck bleeding a lot. She was covered in a white powder, I believe, diatomaceous earth, which she believes helps repel the insects. The surrounding of her eyes are yellowed ans she looks in very obvious pain.

The problem becomes, that no one else in our family is affected by any ""small black insects"" at all. She believes them to be microscopic or as big as termites. At her age, she is unable to small print at all, so how she is able to see ""microscopic"" insects is incredibly unbelievable. The fact that no one else in the family has been attacked by any ""insects"" is troubling.

Everything that has happened has lead me to believe that my parent may have schizophrenia and I was looking for second opinions on the topic or if anyone else has had a parent or knows of someone who was in a similar situation.

My parent however, refuses to believe she has schizophrenia. She feels in pain over the fact that no one else feels her suffering is is agonized over the fact that she's the only one being attacked by these ""insects"".

The wounds that she ends up with I believe are self-inflicted. I had heard that schizophrenics will occasionally injure or tickle themselves and be completely unaware that it was themselves. I believe that this might be the case with my mother, however, not having her under a 24 hour supervision, I'm unable to prove that.

At this point, we're all on top of a hill in the field that is quite visible from 15-20 houses. I took a deep breath and pulled the stringy stocking from his ass. I kid you not, it was at least 15 inches long. The dog didn't seem to mind but I could feel the disgusted eyes of people that saw the act from their windows. My friend just laughed the whole time.

If she doesn't care about living with her ex, my fear is that it may mean she doesn't value relationships or invest herself in them as much as I do. Then again, maybe the breakup was recent and they haven't been able to move out yet.

I have dropped friendships that were draining and made time for better ones, but still no progress on the relationship front with females. It seems that once people get to know me, I'm just rather weird. How can I get rid of this weird, or can I?

Is this an appropriate way to handle the situation?","Today I got a text from a guy named Bryant who I sometimes hang out with and share many mutual friends with. The message said ""My man, I'm gonna need 40 dollars for that sweater that you took from me"" The sweater he's referring to is one that I found in my car several months ago.

Several months ago I asked my friends if anybody had lost a sweater and Bryant mentioned that he had lost a sweater (never proven to be the one I found). I offered to return it and he declined, never bringing the issue up again.

Today I responded to his message, telling him that I would look for the sweater and return it if I found it, but that I would not give him money as it is not my responsibility to keep track of his clothes. He accused me of stealing it and said that I am ""disappointing"". I replied that I wasn't looking for his approval and that reiterated that I would give him the sweater if I found it.

There's a girl I've liked since I met her a year and a half ago, we'll call her Hannah to make it easier. Hannah and I have been friends with so many interests in multiple organizations in college, but never really hung out or spent a lot of extra time together outside of those commitments and class before the last 6 months. 

I finally coughed up the courage necessary to tell her how I feel and how she makes me feel, what I'd like (a relationship) a month ago. I told her how I'd liked her since I met her and that she never escapes my mind...etc. She told me she felt the same way, but did not want a relationship with me (at least right now) because she didn't think it would work. She cited assertiveness amongst her reasons. 
This was devastating and confusing, and I really put her aside for a while to try and get over her. I just couldn't. I went on a date or two, no luck. Then, when we met back up finally, we seemed closer than ever. She fell asleep on top of me multiple times after we watched movies together late at night, seeming very flirtatious and ""cuddly"" altogether. 

Now, we text and talk constantly and are always looking for excuses to see each other. Question is, do I take this as her reaching for something more or do I still take what she said as fact and assume that she doesn't want a relationship at first? What does she want?

I didn't want to waste it so I googled how much data streaming a movie would take and it said 1-3gbs so I decided to use my phone as a hotspot and watch I'm Still Here on Netflix. Woke up in the morning to a $150 fee added to my $40 phone bill. I called them and the guy I spoke to initially estimated 3-4gbs for a movie, but when I pointed out I had apparently used 7 he thought that was normal too. He straight away said he could get half of the bill knocked off, and I just agreed to that because I (clearly) am not very technologically informed. I guess I'm just frustrated that their automatic setting for going over your data is to charge you $70 a gb instead of just adding their $10 1gb data pack to your plan and then they can't even text me to let me know until I've already blown through $150 worth. I received 3 emails (even though they manage to text me about paying my bill) about four hours after I watched the movie saying I was 50%, 75% and 100% over my data limit, and then another few hours later finally got a text saying I'd used all my data.

992, I asked my 5 year old to give up a toy she really wanted in exchange for a goat for a charity.  She was very upset and I feel like crap about it.  Should I buy the toy (and tell her its from Santa),"A friend told me about a family Christmas tradition where they ask their children to give up one gift off their ""wish-list"" in exchange for putting that money towards a charity. This seemed like a great idea so I attempted it with my 5 year old daughter and it didn't go that well. Instead of letting her pick, I suggested a toy castle she wants (and already has a couple similar) and in exchange, suggested we buy a less fortunate family a goat through a charity site.

It turned out to be a far more challenging decision for her to make than I anticipated and it took lots of explaining and tears. Turns out she really wanted that castle. She finally made the right choice and reluctantly agreed. However in hindsight I feel like it was too intense of a request to ask from a 5 year old, that maybe I was too pushy and generally I feel like crap about the whole thing.  By the time she went to bed I think she was feeling good about her decision and it hasn't come up again.

Now I have two choices: 1) Complete the ""lesson"", stick to my plan and just not buy it.  The charity is sending a card with a picture of the goat I was going to put under the tree for thanks. 2). ""Reward"" her kind act by still buying the castle and say its from Santa and he decided to give to her because he was ""so impressed with her generous act"".  Thus still making her extremely happy and surprised Xmas morning.

Needless to say she is getting other toys she requested Xmas morn.

Prepare yourselves, this is going to be a bit long. 

A bit of backstory:
Back in December my now ex SO started our relationship - he lived in Ireland and I was in the UK. He then moved to Germany in January for a few months and we still continued to happily be together while he tried to start a career. We kept visiting one another when we could and things were great. He then had a job opportunity in Korea come up and we decided to end things mutually on my last visit due to the increase of distance - we lasted a good 4-5 months being long distance. Since then, we have seen each other a few times (we have a good many mutual friends and met each other in quite a tight-knit community) and I still have very strong feelings for him and we still are trying to be friends even though its difficult controlling our feelings for one another (I know this because the last time we saw each other we slept together again).

Now he's currently back in Ireland and I'm going over there soon for work reasons and have an opportunity to see him again very briefly. We've both been single now for 2 months and it has been hell for me. I want to ask him to give our relationship another shot and tell him how I really feel. I really think that we can work as a relationship again even though the distance between us is going to increase when he moves to Korea in a couple of months.

995," I have feelings for my best friend, but I don't want to lose my boyfriend, who I love very much, because of it. I don't want to lose my best friend because of it, either, but that's a different story.","First things first, I love my boyfriend to death, and I would never, ever, ever cheat on him. We've been together for over a year now, and I can sincerely say that I deeply care about him. We don't share the same outlook and we may ague sometimes, but it's fine. There seems to be a small problem with us not being fully honest with each other, which kind of bugs me.

Then I have a best friend.

We've been friends for three years now. We share the same outlook, expect the same things from relationships, and we are completely comfortable with being fully honest with each other. He's witty, kind, and endlessly entertaining.

Due to  timing conflicts, I've been spending more time with my best friend than my boyfriend, and for the past 6 (maybe 7) months, I have started to feel very drawn to my best friend. I dismissed it as a passing crush at first, but the fact I haven't been able to shake it off for 7 months is extremely annoying.

My boyfriend has expressed jealousy for my friend in the past, even going as far as saying shit like: ""Well, why don't you go date {best friend} then, huh?"" So a part of me knows he's slowly picking up on it.

I don't want to make my boyfriend miserable, he truly does not deserve it, but I don't want to walk out of my relationship for something like this.

Keep in mind, my best friend is 8 years older than me (I'm 20), so that's another thing that holds me back from pursuing anything further, as he said over a year ago that ""I was too young for him"". Despite this, we see eye to eye in many, many things, and we do seem to care deeply about each other.

Ideally, I would be able to shake off my feelings for my best friend. I would never act upon this as:

a) I adore my boyfriend despite our conflicts, though we've been growing apart lately.

b) I don't want to fuck up my best, most stable friendship.

996, I told her how much I loved her and she rejected me. She said she was unhappy with me and that seeing me with other girls would crush her. She ignored my words and stated that she hopes that will change for her and she hopes it does,"I posted yesterday, I was losing my mind trying to figure out if I should express my feelings for her or not as I didnt want to burden her (she said she loved me but wasnt sure how she felt about us in a relationship anymore). Anyways.. I told her how I truly loved her and I dont want to love or even go out with any girl but her and that seeing her with other people in a romantic way would crush me. I hoped that would at least merit some response, maybe she would acknowledge that she cares for me and is still jealous for me.

Instead, she ignored my words and simply stated that she cant be tied to anything and be happy, at this point. She said maybe that will change for her and she hopes it does. I was told it isn't fair to either of us to be in a relationship where one of us is unhappy. And that makes sense to me, I just failed to realize she was unhappy with me.

Usually this would drive me up the wall. My normal response would be to start crying, feel hurt and disregarded, and then start yelling at everything while punching my punching bag. I mean, my love was rejected.. worse, it wasn't acknowledged. But now, as I type this, I just am. I dont feel good or bad. I've said all I can to her and she knows exactly how I feel. 

There is not point in caring anymore; it either will or it wont work out for us. I realize that pleading and hoping is futile. She doesn't know what she wants and it is now apparent she won't trouble herself with my cares. I feel like this should hurt but I dont feel anything about it right now. I just feel a little bit sleepy. I feel like my body is numb.

997," I bought some electronics on Craigslist, but the seller may have accidentally blacklisted the Kindle (and possibly other devices) as stolen. I want to recover it, but I don't know where to start.","Found some electronics at a very good price (i.e. not ""too good to be true"", but cheaper than average) on my local Craigslist. The transaction was fairly innocuous: met in daylight at a shopping plaza, and all items were turned on to show that they weren't broken. 

However, when we tried to connect the Kindle, it refused to register. A quick call to Amazon determined that the serial # in question was blacklisted as lost/stolen. The seller had stated that the device was de-registered and wiped, so it was *possible* that it had been accidentally blacklisted as part of that transaction.

I called the seller back, but all I was able to say was ""hello, I purchased some electronics from you yesterday evening--"" before the call was ended by the other party. Subsequent calls rang, but were never picked up.

So at this point, I can't *prove* the Kindle was stolen, but there's a fair bit of suspicious action from the seller's part. I sent a quick ""please explain the blacklisting"" text, but I expect the next major step will be giving the local police a heads up. I still have the Craigslist posting ID and a print out of the ad, so if they cared to, they could subpoena the blahblahblahblah, but that's not my decision.

In the meantime, I've googled the mobile number and it's not coming up with much info--it's a common local area code, and I'm pretty sure I know which carrier it is, but unless I want to impersonate the account holder, I don't know how to get more info.

998, GF and I had an argument about her not being 100% confident that I have not cheated on her. She said it makes her question whether or not she has cheated on me. Is it reasonable for me to feel this way? How should I proceed,"Quick back story. My girlfriend made a friend [21F] last year that I quickly became friends with as well. I started to become better friends with her than she was. After a few months, GF becomes concerned/paranoid/insecure that there is something between us since we became close friends and talk a lot. I assure her that we're only friends, but it doesn't help and many arguments manifest. She wants me to cut contact with her which puts me in an awkward situation. Eventually she silently cuts contact with said friend, which makes my relationship with her awkward since she doesn't understand what is going on with my GF. Over time we become more distant and our relationship becomes chatting once or twice a month. It's been that way for a few months now, and things have been normal with my GF.

Recently I was staying the night with my girlfriend. We were just talking in bed when we came to the topic of cheating. I don't remember the exact details of the conversation, but it wasn't anything serious, just lighthearted talk and not specifically about us. At one point she said something that made me ask her, ""Do you think I've cheated on you?"" She replied with only, ""Well, I can't really say no for sure."" This made me upset, and although she tried assuring me that she ""trusted me"", she didn't seem to understand why it upset me.

Sure, no one knows 100% whether or not their partner has cheated on them. But, if you don't have a strong reason to believe that they have, I think the answer should be no. Her not being totally confident that I have not cheated really upsets me. I don't feel trusted. It's obviously due to the events from my back story. I never gave her a reason to think I cheated other than the fact that I simply had a friend that was female. It makes me kind of angry that she would say this after things have seemed good and normal for a while now. Is it reasonable for me to feel this way? How should I proceed from here?

He and his brother plan on meeting up for the last 2 weeks he is there to travel around and see the sights, e.g. Paris, Eiffel Tower, Stonehenge.

I'm having huge jealousy issues that are starting to spill over into my conversations with him. I'm snappy, sarcastic, and just generally unsupportive. Mostly, I'm upset because he gets to go without spending a dime of his own money. His parents bought his plane tickets and gave him 300 euro in spending money while he is abroad. Furthermore, his mother promised to deposit 100 dollars, american, into his bank account each week for ""extra spending money."" They have bought him a $200 backpack, clothes, toiletries, AND what is likely a $500 digital camera.

I find the situation ridiculous. He does not need to also be receiving a paycheck from his mother. I suppose I'm also upset because he doesn't have a job, and has normally a $100 balance on a month to month basis - while I work a part-time job just to stay afloat on my rent, and have money for groceries. His parents pay for all of that too.

* she put herself in a position where this was allowed to happen. Why not kick him out immediately?

* when I asked her where he touched her, she said she didn't want to talk about it but said it was nowhere intimate, more along the lines of forcing himself on her

Now, onee my boyfriend graduates, he said he would most likely want to get a job in St. Louis or Kansas City (a different state than I'm from). Now, I told him I'm fine with moving wherever he gets a job, but he told me yesterday he didn't plan on being engaged until after we lived together. Now, to me, that's super scary to move to a new city where I may have trouble finding a job and then not even being engaged. He also mentioned he is not worried about me finding a job and we'd figure out finances since he will most likely be making enough to cover both of us and he could ""loan"" me the money in the meantime. Now, I'm not sure what that means. 

I guess, this is a year from now, but I'm freaking out a bit about the idea of moving to a new state, not engaged, not being able to find a job in my field easily (I'll have a year experience in it at that point but again, the unrelated degree). Do you have any advice? He mentioned that he's serious about us and sees a future with us but also that he is scared to think about committing his whole life with marriage right now.

Over the last couple of months, I've gotten a lot closer to her and talk to her much more than I used to. Whenever we hang out we always end up talking and always hit it off. 

I decided to ask her out but I have been a little weary of doing so. I don't want to ruin our friendship or make things awkward between us. Another issue is that I can never seem to get a moment alone with her. We're always with our group of friends and I don't want to ask her out in front of everyone. I don't find that to be fair to her. I feel like it puts her on the spot.

The most time I ever get alone with her is whenever someone decides to get up and leave for a moment but its never enough time to get anywhere.

But a few nights ago, I was talking to one of our friends. He had asked me out of the blue how things were going with myself and this girl. I hadn't told him anything about trying to get with this girl. When I asked him how he knew, he said it was very obvious. He said our body language and the way we were around each other was different than with everyone else. In addition, he said a few other people said the same exact thing. Now it is pretty much an open secret among our friends that there is something between us.

I can't lie, that was great to hear from him and gave me more confidence in asking her out. But like I said earlier, getting alone with her is always an issue. 

So I must ask, would texting her to ask her out be out of line? I personally feel that texting someone to ask them out is kind of low and not something that I would prefer but I just can't seem to get her alone.

As of late, however, she's been complaining that we don't see each other as much as we used to.

Which is absolutely true, we haven't. But really this isn't my fault for several reasons.

The first reason is where she lives. She used to live, literally, a 5 minutes walk away, but since her mom has been in a car accident, she has had to live at her grandmother's house. which is 30 minutes drive away.

The second reason is her inability to plan anything. She comes from a very spontaneous family where planning is considered silly, and they enjoy living a chaotic lifestyle. This is the polar opposite of my family. We are very ordered and structured. I always try to make plans with her, but she says things like ""My family doesn't plan things, I have no idea whether or not I'll be free that day"". 

Then, she'll just randomly say things like ""hey, want to go out and do something"" on days that I swear she told me she was busy, and then gets upset when I don't drop everything I'm doing and interrupt everyone else's plans. She doesn't understand why I can't just leave on the drop of a hat because she really doesn't understand the concept of planning.

Finally, it's her schedule. I'm literally available 6 days out of 7. I'm only busy on SOME Tuesdays. Unlike her, who has something EVERY SINGLE Monday, Wednesday, Thurday, and Friday, and usually stuff on both days of the weekend as well. Then she complains that I'm ""never available"" when really what she means to say is ""never available when I want you to be available"".

It's very upsetting when she gets angry at me when really it isn't my fault at all. I take a lot of shit from her for it, and I'm always the one who ends up apologizing even though I did nothing wrong and really the fault is on her end.

like the title says, I'm very in love with her. She is in a long distant relationship, and she thinks that her boyfriend will break up with her (because she want's to go au-pair to another coutry).(Don't get me wrong, I don't want her to quit her boyfriend for me, I only wanted to say this)

She and I have many things in common, and a few days ago she invited me to her appartment, to give me some films I wanted. I was there for about 1 1/2 hours, and we talked the whole time with each other. She said I could come over any time I want. I liked it very much. I frequently write with her, too, end then we end up writing for 2 hours or so.
She's also very kind to me, but I don't know how I shall interpret this whole thing, I'm confused right now, but I really love her.

I didn't tell her yet, because I don't want to make her to force (don't know an other english word) her to make a decision.

What should I make, should I wait and see what happens with her realationship? We're in the last scholar year, I don't know if I'll be able to see her after school as frequently as now.

1007," I have a body that doesn't look like it belongs to a 24 year old woman, and I'm not sure if I should tell her about it early on, if we were to date. If so, when is the best time to tell her","Heya Ladies of Reddit! (English is not my first language, so I hope everything will be understandable).

Alrighty, I have been been very overweight and now lost quite a bit of that weight, but still not at an optimal ""lean"" weight, but my body does. In clothes I look normal or maybe chubby-ish. Without clothes I dont' look too good, stretch marks, some loose skin mixed with moobs and love handles. 

I get compliments for my face (not only from my mother, but from her too, love you mum) from women, and that's I think a lot of women actually expect me to have a ""normal"" body, since that would seem ""matching"". Well, as you know by now that's not the case. 

Anyways, what I want to ask is, would you want me to tell you this early on, if you were dating me? I sometimes feel like a fraud, if someone really likes me and we start to click. I think ""would she think this way if she would know about what's under my clothes? Should I tell her right now?"" Or maybe it's now even that big of a deal?

I think the scenario I'm having in my head is that we start to really like each other and when she finally sees my body, she will be really upset about it since that is not what she signed up for. Now, I would like to think that she won't care, but I also have to be realistic here, both things could happen. 

I should also mention I'm only 24 and I have a feeling people my age are a little bit more superficial, but maybe I'm just talking silly and should get outta me head.

1009, I want my bicurious SO to be sure of his sexuality and not worry about what will 'hurt me' or what is best for me. Is it wrong for me to want him be sure of himself? Is there a better way to,"Hello there~

Story goes, both myself and SO are a little bicurious. Him a little more public than myself, as I'm still discovering my preferences. But we're comfortable with each other's decisions and choices and strongly encourage one another to be open about new discoveries.

Issue is, I know he's tempted to act on his curiosity, even though he's convinced me there's no way he could bring himself to do so. My best friend who came out a couple months ago has long since had a crush on him and there's always been joking of them two hooking up for a night. Guilty me; for a while I cheered it on playfully but I think SO is starting to crack.

I feel sometimes like I'm holding him back. Polygamy isn't exactly something I'm crazy to get into, nor would I want to make it a permanent option. Is it wrong for me to want him be sure of himself? There's so many gray areas in these times of discovery that I'm not sure what's right to ""encourage"" or help him act upon.

A lot of this is getting filtered to him as paranoia, which is partially an outcome. But I really want him to decide what's best for him and not worry about what will 'hurt me' or what is best for me. As far as loving someone goes, he is someone I could spend my life with. But I don't want my ""satisfied"" mentality to blockade him from what could also satisfy him.

We broke up a 2 months ago, because he said ""he didn't feel comfortable around me, in the same way as when he's with his friends"". Also, he said when you're in a relationsship, you're supposed to be best friends, which we weren't. He also mentioned, that he didn't feel he could support me the way a boyfriend should be able to.
 
We agreed to still be friends, and I admitted, that I still loved him, and he said he loved me too. A week after, he texted me telling me, that he had been to a psychologist, and he had a depression.
 
We've met up a few times since, but never talked about feelings. But lately, he's hardly ever contacted me, it's just me, who starts the conversation over text or skype, and it's only me, who takes the initiative to meet up. 
I know, he's not at his very best, and that's probably why he hardly ever contacts me. 

But recently I've become unsure, if I should continue contacting him. Do you think it's worth it? Should I talk about how I feel? Or should wait until he feels better?

I am a 23F, and I fell really hard for another woman (""C"") who is twice my age, married with children. ""C"" and I felt a deep and immediate connection, but she viewed me more as one of her children, whereas I felt quite differently...  Maybe it was infatuation on my part, so my feelings would lessen over time? No, 3 years later and I still feel this way. ""C"" is the most beautiful person in the world, yet other people do not see it (aside from her husband I guess...)

I love her so much, all I really want is for her to live a happy life with her husband (he better treat her right or else!). At first I tried to avoid her, but she sensed my awkwardness and fragility, so she tried to be friendly and act as a mentor/mother figure towards me. I thought maybe this friendship thing could work out, but it is true that you can't just be friends...

""C"" has shown me such kindness, but she has no idea what I have felt all this time, and she can never know. If she could just say or do something mean or cruel, then I could think less or her. But she will never do that. So I need to break this off once and for all. Honestly I think the only way is for me to meet someone else, but how do I do that? I have never been in a serious relationship before, so ""dating"" and the ""bar scene"" is extremely foreign to me.

Here's the story. There's plenty more details, but this is what I think is important.

Me and my boyfriend of over a year had been fighting on a Wednesday night, it was particularly nasty due to a bout of depression on my side. But after sleeping on it we have always been good in the morning. I was under the impression that this was the case on Thursday.

Apparently he thought we were still fighting and on the verge of breaking up. I went home for the weekend (we're in college) and he figured we would break up as soon as I got back. So in his mind we were as good as done.

I guess he went on Tinder looking for someone to talk to just so he could feel wanted and not alone. What was supposed to be a walk around the block turned into him kissing her and then making out in a bush for 10 minutes. Just kissing, I know, but **** it still hurts.

He says it was awful and he regretted it as soon as it was over. And he's had 2 months to think about it and try to make up for it without me even knowing about it. He's explained why and told me everything I wanted to know. I only found out because I saw messages between them on Facebook.

Before this happened, we were talking about getting engaged, and it's come up again since I found out because we both still want to be together, I'm just having a really hard time moving past what happened and learning to trust him again.

I never expected this from him, it was the one thing he swore would never happen and I trusted him 100%. Now he says it will absolutely never happen again, but every time I think about what happened I feel sick. What can I do to feel better, or should I even be trying to make things with him work?

I felt that maybe I had no reason to worry and she must still like me right?

She never calls or texts and she keeps saying we're still friends and didn't want it to end, but everything feels very dead.

We go in circles a lot. She tells me about a problem, I give my two cents, and then we have the exact same conversation just a week later. Ive also been really worried about her, afraid that she'll hurt herself. And I feel like, if she does, I'm partially responsible because I'm here to help her. All these conversations and worrying has made my have a few anxiety attacks, I velieve, and my heart has had spells where it acts funny for a few days. It hasn't happened lately, but it could happen again at any time.
And while I do enjoy her company as a friend, it seems like so much of our time is spent talking about her issues that it seems like I'm a counselor and not a friend. She'll change the subject from a normal conversation to a discussion of her problems, and a lot of the time what she talks about is stuff that we've already talked about a million times, and it's driving me crazy. She's seeing a counselor, and I think it's helping, but I can never be sure. She's also on antidepressants.
I'm just at my limit, and I feel trapped. If I say that I don't want to talk about her problems, then I'm afraid she'll hurt herself because she's not venting enough and not having enough help and support. And I'm afraid that she may hurt herself if our friendship ever dissolves (we're really close). What do you guys make of this situation, and do you have any advice you could give me?

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

To set things up: I was at a friends wedding a month ago and had a weekend fling with a friend of his. She stayed two nights with me at my parents place. We said our goodbyes and kept texting over the next week. She sends me a letter and a mixtape online (I know slightly cheesy). She says she feels like we made a connection and I say that I feel the same way. Things seem good so I say I'd like to come visit her and book flight for a stay of 5 days two weeks from now. Then she tells me that in September she'll be moving to the same city as me.

So it all seems good, but my anxiety/insecurity is getting the better of me. She hangs out with a lot of guys and has been hosting couchsurfers for the past week. I'll see a picture of them on Facebook and I can't help, but think she's hooking up with them on the side.

To be honest though it wouldn't really bother me if she would be honest with me. We aren't dating, we aren't exclusive so anything that she does is her perogative. I just don't want to get burned. I can't tell if what she says is honest or if she just wants attention.

I also feel like I have no one to talk to because everyone just tells me to play it cool and not to think about it too much. I feel like I am crazy and overthinking things.

She's really quiet so we never talk much other than hi and bye.  She pays the rent so I don't need much else.

Annie has her boyfriend(?) sleeping over quite often.  Let's call him Ben.  I'm not actually 100% sure Ben and Annie are dating, they could just be friends with benefits.  I never asked because I don't know either of them well, and it's none of my business, until now.

A couple weeks ago my friends and I were hanging out at a bar.  Annie also happened to be there (the bar is nearby my apartment), so we say hi and I introduced her to some of my friends.  I noticed my friend Charlie and her were chatting quite a bit.  Charlie later told me Annie is cute, and wants to know her more.  I told him, she has a boyfriend, leave it at that.

Fast forward to last Friday, my (other) friends and I were chatting and they noted that Charlie and Annie were hooking up.  I was flabbergasted.  Ben just slept over yesterday (Sunday).  I was confirming with my friends again and again if they're sure it's Annie, and they said yes, they saw Charlie and Annie at Charlie's apartment.

So... I considered not minding anyone's business, but I figured I'll post here anyways for the hive mind's advice.

I don't know the following, which makes it all tricky:

* Are Annie and Ben dating / exclusive?
* Does Charlie know Annie is still dating? (maybe he thought she broke up?)
* Does Ben know anything?
* Charlie's also my friend, not too close, but I want to make sure he's eyes open in this.

Have been dating this guy for about 3 months. We live about 3 hours from each other, but that isn't really an issue. We've been very flexible with visiting each other. We've ""only"" been on 4 dates total, where 3 of them have been spent as entire weekends at each others apartments.

In that time period I assumed we weren't exclusive, so was dating other people and having fun. Last weekend I spent the weekend at his place, and he seemed very surprised that we weren't exclusive. We talked about it, and agreed to become exclusive, as we both like each other and want to know where it's going.

The thing is, after this weekend, he has been really unresponsive in texting and communication. He doesn't really seem to want to talk to me at all. That is fine in itself, but before we became exclusive he texted me all the time, and seemed kind of annoyed when I didn't reply. I mean, different people text differently, I get that. But just seems weird to me that he doesn't want to communicate at all in the beginning of brand new and exciting relationship. I just can't get rid of this gut feeling I have, that now that we're exclusive he lost interest in pursuing me...

I have no idea how to talk to him or if I even should. I don't want to be needy or pushy, but on the other hand, I really want to know if he lost interest, so I don't waste my time and feel annoyingly insecure, because I don't know where I have him.

He's a great guy and I honestly have very little to complain about.

The issue lies where I just don't find 'us' exciting anymore. It's not the sex, it's just the relationship as a whole. Everything is repetitive and bland, and I really just don't know what to do about it. 

We are going on holiday in a few months and are also living with each other for another year which makes matters somewhat more difficult.

I have approached the subject of breaking up before and I'm normally told that ""If we break up, I can't be friends with you"" or he starts crying.

I have no real reason as to why I don't feel the same, I think it's just what has happened over the time we've spent together and I know he wouldn't accept that. He is possessive and would most likely think that if I was breaking up with him, it would be for someone else, which is absolutely not the case.

Essentially I'm looking for advice on the next steps and if need be, how to go about ending things on good enough terms to spend the next year in close proximity. I don't want to have to keep lying and making things worse for the both of us in the long run. I want to stay friends with him.

Beading needles are long (at least two inches) and super sharp. I immediately took him to the vet because I was terrified that it was lodged inside of him. They took two x-rays and said there was no swallowed needle.

Here's the deal folks. My cat is usually SUPER friendly and sociable. He greets me at the door when I come home. He asks for noms when his dish is empty. He talks back to me when I ask him questions. Attu has done none of that today. All he's done since I've brought him home is crouch in corners and hide. My cat NEVER does this.

Of course I am going to call the vet tomorrow. I was just wondering...do you think there is any possibility that the vet might have missed the needle? I haven't found it yet and I have this nagging feeling it's lodged in his throat or the roof of his mouth.

I try not to be negative towards people, but sometimes it just flows. This is what she can't stand. She understand that it's hard for me, but I don't think she comprehends how difficult it actually is. So when she points out how I'm being rude or difficult, I get defensive. 

This in turn causes a small argument. I hate that we fight and I don't want to. It just feels that she is attacking me. I know she is not, but I remind myself that after it is too late.

I don't want to lose this woman. She is great. She makes me happy. I want to simply return her kindness and caring and honestly don't know how.

1047, Boyfriend is on trip and I have a paralyzing fear that he will like another girl more than me and not want to come back to me. I feel embarrassed to ask for help but I really need it.,"I'm sure I'll be blown off because of my age, but I am having a nervous breakdown. Recently things have been exceedingly hard, and I'm having a hard time coping. My boyfriend has been there for me and is a sweetheart, we don't fight and I never have to worry about anything with him--- until now. 

He's going on a two week backpack trip and I can't contact him whatsoever. For some reason, despite knowing he would never in a thousand years cheat on me, I worry he will find another girl on the trip and like her more than me. I'm trying so hard to reason with myself but I have this paralyzingly fear this trip will make him not like me. I know it's unreasonable and I'm overreacting, but I don't know what to do. This is the first time we've been apart for a long time and I miss him terribly. He said he loved me and he'd write a journal everyday about his trip like I asked him to so he'd be able to remember it. 

Does anyone have any advice or can help me? I feel ashamed of myself for freaking out so badly. I feel embarrassed just writing this but I really want some help or kind words.

1048," I have no savings, no credit, and no credit history. Is it worth taking out a student loan to get a new computer in college (engineering degree, 3.5 years left in college) that will last me the rest of my life (","I am a 21 year old college student, I'm in my junior year of an engineering degree. I intend to get my masters as well, so I am looking at a good 3.5 years of school still to go.
My current computer is 4 years old and starting to fall apart (cd player cover has fallen off, hinge is getting unstable, ect.), but still runs ok for now. There is no way that it will last all the way through my education, so I will definitely need a new computer at some point.

I have been able to stay out of debt thus far. I have scholarships that have covered my tuition and I live at home in order to avoid paying for housing/rent. I have always had a job while in school, but usually with very few overall hours. After my normal expenses (gas, food, phone bill, ect.) I usually have very little money left over, so I have pretty much no money in savings. I would have to cut a lot of expenses for a long period of time to save enough money for a new computer.

So my question: Is it worth taking out my first (and hopefully only) student loan in order to get a new computer? In engineering I use my computer a lot and I need something relatively powerful to run some of the software I use. I would ideally like to get something like the Surface Book ($1700) or maybe even the Surface Pro 4 ($1300).

Schools that don't offer refunds will usually let you take the bootcamp again, for free.

Seeing as I hadn't had very many conversations with her, it was probably a good choice anyway.

He hasn't spoken to me since that night which was this past Saturday and I do not know if I should be calling him to apologize or if I should just let him get over it eventually. I did apologize for staying at the party later than originally planned, but I did not apologize for staying at the party after he left. Does he feel that I chose my friends over him? I am so confused.

1067, Dad may have been using backpage and viewing massages. He claims he went out for a beer after having two drinks before leaving. He is divorced and not in a relationship. What do I do?,"I'm going to let you know straight up (for those who like reading drama) that he is divorced and isn't in a relationship. 

Some background:
Some time ago I was on his computer. In the browser, I started typing ""beach"" and up came a long list of auto fill URLs that have our city in it (ends in beach). I didn't have any proof it was him as it could have also been my brother who also uses that computer randomly (though he doesn't live with us).

Actual story:
Last night, I came home with my dad and boyfriend from a dinner at a restaurant. My dad had had a Margarita and a beer ( I promise this is relevant). So, when we got home, I went to take my boyfriend back home and we were gone for only 15 minutes or so.  
I get back home and can't find my dad anywhere. I called him a few times because my grandma is in the hospital so I wasn't sure if something went wrong and he went to see her. I also called the hospital and they told me she was fine. 
I thought that was pretty weird that he seemingly waiting until I left so that he could leave. 
I noticed his computer screen was on so he must've used it before he left. I thought, ""Maybe he saw something that made him leave?"" So, I checked his history. I find several backpage links that were viewed *that day* and a lot about supposed massages. Others were more obvious about what they were. 
He finally called me back after an hour or so to tell me he ""went out for a beer."" That doesn't make sense to me since he already had 2 drinks before leaving AND he had to wake up early for work the next day. I told him I didn't believe him but left it at that. 

How do I confront him? Should I? He will likely try to change the issue onto me snooping on him to avoid talking about it and he'd likely flat out lie (assuming he did do what I think he did).
What do you think?

1068," I've developed feelings for a girl I've known for years, but she has a complicated relationship with her mother and I don't know if I should go for it. If so, how should I go about it, or if I should even do","I've known this girl, we'll call her Julia. Julia and I have been friends for as long as I can remember, and although we started off not liking each other, we eventually grew quite fond of one another. Her mom and my mom became best friends and are pretty much inseparable, and we've been on several vacations together. I've never seen her as anything other than my friend, if that makes any sense? As in, she was a friend who happened to be a girl.

 Well, a few years go by, out parents drift apart, and I see Julia maybe a few dozen times a year. Our parents recently reconnected, but she has a weird relationship with her mother, and she doesn't really come over when her mom does, so I don't get to see her other than during holidays or my birthday.

 I feel guilty for feeling this way towards somebody I felt was a friend. I feel like I'm turning into a nice guy, because I keep thinking of ways to ask her out, or ways to get her alone during a party and stuff. I even think about sappy romantic stuff like going on dates to ice skating rinks and stuff haha. I know it's corny, but I honestly can't help it, I've become pretty much infatuated with her.

 If I asked Julia out, or showed any signs of wanting her, I'm pretty sure that it would cause some drama with her mother and mine if it got ugly for some reason I can't fathom at this moment. Should I go for it? How should I do it? Wait for me to see her again during a party and risk it not even happening? Or message her? Should I just give up altogether? I honestly never felt this way towards a friend before and it's a lot more complicated(In my mind at least) than a regular crush.

At the time, she was 6 weeks and I was keeping her inside in a crate next to my bed. She would cry for about 10 minutes every hour through out the night.

I could not get her to stop and my roommates were getting fed up after about a week and a half so I let her outside with my older dog. It's been a month and I would like to try again. Am I expecting too much from her at such a young age? I would also like to know if she is too young to potty train. I keep her inside during the day but I was constantly cleaning up messes.

1071," I have a hard time communicating my feelings and emotions to my partner, and I want to learn how to communicate better and not bury my feelings. I want to learn how to communicate better with everyone, but especially my partner.","We've been together almost 5 years, and both close to graduating undergrad (both plan on pursuing higher ed). 

We've had more highs than I can count, but a good amount of lows too. Most of those are due to the fact that a lot of time when we have serious discussions (like issues with the relationship or sometimes if she is just trying to correct me on something) I usually freeze up, stonewall, or I get extremely nervous and stop being productive in the conversation. She can always tell when I'm getting upset and when she'll ask me if she said something that upset me or if something else was bothering me. I'll always say no, or I'm just anxious but not that bad, and then when we talk about it later she was right. I bury my feelings a lot and am scared of confrontation with almost anyone. 

I'm also really bad at introspection to begin with, like really bad. I think in my upbringing my family never *dealt* with issues and I didn't see my parents too much. I spent most of my free time with the same equally awful friends. Growing up I didn't learn how to sit with my emotions and have productive conversations with people. I'd just remove myself and sit in silence until they were finished talking so everything would go back to normal. 

We've had this issues more times than I can count and I desperately want to stop this immature behavior. I know it's wrong, yet every time I start to get anxious I end up repeating the same behavior. It usually takes us all night, if not a day or two, to finish talking about issues. Even so, that behavior usually reverts back after a few days.  

I know I'm in the wrong here. I finally believe I'm starting to get a grip on myself, and I know I probably need therapy, but I just want to be able to communicate with my partner. I'm trying to find a way to show my SO because we've tried talking this matter to death.

1073," I met a guy, we kissed, he said it was a mistake and that we shouldn't ever do it again. He's acting weird now and I met another guy who seems really into me. What to do?","20 year old female here. I've been friends with this guy (18 yo) for about a year now, and a couple of months ago I started to feel more than friendship. After some time I started to think that maybe he felt the same for me, but I wasn't sure.

Then, on a night some weeks ago, we kissed. We spent the whole night making out, lying in each other's arms. For the record, both of us hadn't drunk at all that night. We were both stone cold sober. In the morning, out of the blue, he told me that it had been a mistake and that we should never EVER do it again. He said I was the coolest girl he knew, but that he was not capable of being in a relationship at the moment and that he didn't want to jeopardize our friendship. I told him it was fine and he shouldn't worry about it, and then left. Hurt like a bitch. After that I kept seeing him every week, as friends of course. I still felt the same way, but he didn't need to know that, right? 

However, he's acting weird lately. He says stuff about us doing sexual things and acts pretty jealous when I'm talking or even standing close to other guys. Also, I found out that he's been checking what I've been putting on my main Reddit account (yes, this one is obviously a throwaway). 

Now I've met this other guy. We share some interests, get along great and he seems really interested in me. But every time I think about him and ask myself if I like him, the first guy pops back in my mind again and seems to fill up every bit of space in my head.

What should I do? I have tried to forget about guy no. 1, but it's as if something is telling me that I should hold on to him. On the other hand, I ask myself what use there would be in that. What do you guys think?

1078, Boyfriend is overly flirty with other girls and says inappropriate things to them. He doesn't see a problem with it and doesn't understand why I feel uncomfortable with it. What can I do if I'm not overreacting and what else can,"While we have only been dating for two months, we have been friends for almost 2 years. He's always been really flirty, and when you're single, that's fine. But when you're in a relationship, certain behaviors kinda need to stop.

It's frustrating because I've had multiple conversations about his behavior with him and how it makes me uncomfortable and how I don't like it. For our most recent conversation, I tried telling him that when he is flirty, touchy, and says inappropriate things to other girls, it doesn't make me feel special as a girlfriend and that I'm in competition with all these other girls. He said ""oh my god, we should get a $5 pizza."" I just feel as if there is a huge lack of respect for me in this relationship. Plus, I muster up a lot of courage to talk about my feelings to him because while he doesn't call me crazy, the tone he uses to talk to me insinuates I'm overreacting. We've had three conversations, one night (while drinking) I blew up at him in public, and then the next night, tried playing along. So I feel like I've done all I can, I just don't see how it's fair to me to compromise my feelings so he can fulfill his ""needs"" of being overly flirtatious. This has also been causing trust issues the relationship.

Another time, he was planning a trip to a different with 4 girls and I saw it on Twitter. I asked him about it and he said it was all hypothetical, but then laughed at me because he thought the whole situation was ridiculous. I then asked him how he would feel if the situation was reversed and he said it would suck.

TL;DR: I met a woman who I met once","So I met this woman about a year ago when we were co-workers and we ended up finding out we had quite a bit in common and enjoyed each others company. She recently left while I'm still partly there as I go through the process of getting hired into my career field (the company was a typical grocery store while I'm entering the IT field now). At the time she was being manipulated by some deadbeat buy in Maryland who she thought she was dating who kept taking money from her and I seemed to be the shoulder to cry on about how bad the guy was. During this time I attempted to date her but was more or less turned down and rather than continue that game I instead moved on to focus on continuing to better myself. I for the most part stopped really interacting with her for 5-6 months during which time she seemed to figure out what the guy in Maryland was doing and moved on and now about 2 months ago we started frequently talking again.

Though unlike last time the conversations have went in ways that give me a sense of mixed signals. Now, maybe I'm wrong here, I find it unlikely woman just randomly talk to guys about their vibrators or mention they're talking to them naked etc. and, in most cases, I'd take that as a obvious sign of interest. Though in her case when I go to do anything with her it's instantly 'not a date'. She's a very timid person so maybe that can play a part in that (plus the whole Maryland thing) but another side of me almost thinks she enjoys the attention I give her or that she's just so comfortable around me as a 'friend' that she thinks it's normal to talk to me about that stuff. At this point I'm stuck between whether I should cut contact most or all the way with her or go hang out with her on the 'not dates' and see where things eventually go. I'm honestly quite inexperienced with woman and dating as I've been a fairly introverted/non social person most my life until the past few years so at times I feel somewhat lost as to what to do.

I was dealing with alot of stress, I'm an introvert she's and extrovert. I thought all of my stress was coming from problems I had at work but now I look back and see that some of it also came from her.

I tried to do everything I could to make her happy and nothing felt like it was working.

After we broke up some of our friends told me she spoke to them more about her problems with me than she did to me. 

Now for the breakup. We decided we were going  to take a week apart and see how we felt. Well she tried to turn a week into two because she was too busy to talk to me. I think this was just because she was scared to say what she decided. I basically told her I couldn't wait anymore that it was eating me alive so she then broke up with me in a text message but said sorry she thought I deserved better than that, later on in a phone call she said I wasn't  going anywhere in  life which really hurt me.

For starters, they made it extremely clear that I was a huge disappointment, disrespectful, and rude. It threw me off as I knew they wouldn't be thrilled but not this pissed. They preceded to say that this piercing was a dagger in their heart because it reminded them of my horrible birth mom and it goes to show I am just like her. They know how much I do not want to be compared to her ever. They then tell me its disrespectful because I never discussed it( I am 18 this shouldn't be a discussion).

She blamed herself and now I don't know how to handle the situation.,"I have been going out with this girl for the last few months and asked her to spend the night a few nights ago. I have had issues in the past with maintaining an erection so I asked the doctor for some medicine to be prepared. I took 15 mg of Cialis before she came over. When we went to bed things started getting hot and heavy. She was rubbing her ass on me and I told her I was getting pretty hard. We made out for a while, and I was completely into the moment and thought I was enjoying it. I wasn't concerned about maintaining an erection because I thought the Cialis would take care of it. She then she asked if I had a condom. It was about this time I noticed that my erection was gone. She stimulated me directly, but I wasn't able to get a full erection again. Sex was not had, and needless to say the night ended badly. She left pretty quickly in the morning.

I think I have confidence issues/performance anxiety. When I'm masturbating, I have no problem getting hard or orgasming. However, this was an issue in the past with my previous girlfriend as well. I would get hard, start having sex, and then basically fake it. I thought the issue was that I wasn't that attracted to my previous girlfriend, but this new girl is drop-dead sexy so I don't think that's it. I really don't understand what's going on with me, and how I can move past it.

The new girl blamed herself. She said she thought she just doesn't turn me on.

I don't know if she bought it. I really like this girl, we get along amazingly, and I don't want my sexual issues to end this relationship, but I just don't know how to move forward with this. Is there any advice anyone has that might be able to help me, both with the sexual issue and how to handle this relationship in particular? I don't think I'll ever be able to have a relationship without resolving this.

1086," I have bills account with auto payments set up, but forgot to cancel auto payments for bills account. Should I pay bills with bills account and keep paying extra on bills due (such as loans and credit cards) or reduce payment on my credit cards (","Hey all -

Apologies if already posted - on mobile. Have heard good things about yall. Maybe yall can help a newb in need of advice. 

So, I'll jump right to it. I have multiple accounts at the moment. A ""bills"" account with checks, which is used for bills. A savings (with weekly deposits of $25 - not much but trying to save). And a ""fun money"" account through simple for spending/short term savings. 

I apparently left an autopay for my car payment turned on in my main bills account and it is posting as we speak. I had already paid the bill manually and didn't get any sort of reminder this autopay was happening until this evening when according to the bank it was ""too late to cancel"" and it will take them 45-90 days to refund the money. The issue is: rent will be paid this week out of my bills account and I hate to pull so much out of savings to be waiting in limbo to be repaid. Should I a) pull out money from my savings to pay for expenses and bills and keep paying extra on bills due (such as loans and credit cards) or b) reduce payment on my credit cards (from $100 over minimum balance to just minimum) for the next few months and put things as needed on them to be repaid in 45-90 days? Aiming to make the best situation happen in this rock and hard place scenario. Hope this makes some sense. It's late and I'm tired and slightly frustrated at myself. :/

1088," I've been talking to other girls behind my girlfriend's back, and I don't know how to make her trust me again after the 3rd time. I really love her and don't want to lose her, but I don't know what to","I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 3.5 years now and practically every year, we've ran into the same problem. I've always been a talkative, flirty guy and I've always gotten along well with girls, and she's caught me multiple times talking or flirting with them. One occasion was flirtatious raunchy texts to a friend, another was just finding that a girl was my #1 friend on snapchat who she had never heard of, and hanging out with a girl without telling her where I was. Despite all this I've never had any physical/sexual interaction with any of these women. 

I know that I'm at fault for doing this behind her back, and I partially blame it on the fact that we're both at two different schools so seeing each other is tough. I can't necessarily explain my motives in the moment, but I guess I've always seen these other girls as people who come and go, and that my future was going to be with my girlfriend. Could it be that I'm in college, which makes me more prone to do stupid things? I've always thought that once we graduated and moved in together and worked real jobs, I'd be able to put this all behind us. 

I'm looking for advice on how to address this problem. We are actually on a break right now because I wanted some time to really look at myself and access what I've done, and hopefully self-reflect on my mistakes. Despite what I've done I value this relationship more than anything in the world (it obv. doesn't seem like it to her), but I can't help but seek attention from other women when my girlfriend isn't around. My friends have told me that I simply take our relationship for granted, and that I don't realize how lucky I have it or how much she does for me. They've told me to write a list of things I'm thankful for my girlfriend for, and hopefully it'll open my eyes to seeing that she's better than all the other girls I talk with. I just don't know how I'm going to regain her trust back after the 3rd time.

TL;DR: I find reading books boring, despite me","Hello there, /r/books! I have a small problem, and I was you guys can help me. But first a little background. 

I, and many people that know me, describe myself as a bookworm, because, what else, I love books. I my opinion, books are more entertaining and more enriching that TV or movies. But the problem is, while I enjoy *books*, I don't enjoy *reading* as much.

What I mean is that I find the process of reading boring. I have a short attention span, am easily distracted, and, to be honest, very lazy. In my free time, while I would rather be reading, I usually find myself glued to the TV or my computer, or both at the same time. I find it difficult to just power down and pick up a book. 

When I do pick up a book, I find the process of reading so tedious and boring, that I have trouble concentrating and actually reading the thing. Sometimes I just sit staring at it, or put it down and go back to whatever it was I was doing before. 

And it doesn't stop at books. Despite me regularly being on the computer, I find reading Internet articles tedious as well, and can't concentrate, and usually exit the page before finishing the article. This problem of mine also makes it very hard for me to study and do homework. 

So what I'm asking is do any of you fine people have any advice for lazy readers with short attention spans? I love books, reading is one of my favorite hobbies, when I finish a book I feel amazing, but at times I find it too hard to concentrate. So, can any of you guys help?

After a few weeks of that happening, I decided I wanted to find out if she was actually glancing at me or just waiting for someone. I ended up finding that she was looking at me pretending to look at the door.

Last week, I accidentally broke an expensive item (~$300) that is necessary for my job and that only I use. BUT no one has discovered it yet and no one knows I broke it. However, they will find out in the next few days. My boss is already not super fond of me and this may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I feel like I have two options:

1) Fess up and explain it was an accident. Pray that they don't fire me and hope they just order a new one. But they might see me as stupid and clumsy and just get rid of me anyway.

2) Toss the item. Pretend it went missing and that I have no idea where it is. Plenty of other people have access to the item, maybe one of them accidentally threw it away or knicked it. But they might think I'm the one that accidentally threw it away (since I'm the only one who uses it) and fire me for my incompetence.

Walking in my neighborhood tonight I ran across one of my more eccentric neighbors, Donna. Donna has a drinking problem and we've run into her before on walks. She is sometimes in her front yard and will scream at my dog to come there, usually when she is holding one of her cats. I've explained REPEATEDLY that Jethro is cat  aggressive and usually I have to drag him away while she yells that he just wants to say hello. No, he wants to eat your cat. 

Tonight she did it again, no cat. When I stopped and held him, she walked over to ""instruct"" me on training him. She grabbed his collar and jerked while screaming at him to sit. I removed her hand, told her I had it under control and left. 

She just showed up at my back door as I was letting him out, drunker than she was when I saw her earlier.  She proceeded to go into the gate of my yard as I asked her not to and start grabbing for my dog as she is spouting César Milan crap at me about being an alpha. She grabbed his collar and started yanking on him again screaming at him to sit. He sat. Shit, I would've been so scared I would have sat down too. By this time, I get down to the yard and she is all but laying on my dog, hugging him. He is clearly uncomfortable and starts barking at her as she keeps telling me, ""See? He's so happy!""

I love Japan. I love the culture, the cleanliness, the people, and everything about it here. I want to work here, settle down here, and it's my dream to raise my kids here. My gf and I have lived in Japan for the last 2 years, and as far as I know, she's enjoying herself here too. We plan to get married here soon, and I want us to stay here indefinitely. I see Japan as a much better place to raise a kid, as the education system is broader, unlike Singapore's which focuses on academics and is highly stressful. 

However, she doesn't share my dream. She wants to go back to Singapore, because she doesn't want to abandon her friends and family. She mopes whenever she misses a friend's birthday or family event back home. From my point of view, we won't miss much if we take regular trips back to Singapore, but she claims it is the daily face-to-face interactions she crave. 

She thought that spending 2 years here with me would be enough for me, and that we will return to Singapore after getting married here. On the other hand, I thought that spending 2 years here together can convince her that it can work out in Japan in the long run, and that we can settle here after getting married.

We've talked about this for the last 3 years and both of us have refused to give in, and we have kicked this can down the road this whole time. We plan to get married in Japan at the end of the month, mainly because I want a Japanese marriage certificate.

I've told her in the past months I've been unhappy, and wanted to seek counseling.  My issues are her lack of affection towards me, and often she can be downright mean. Not name calling or insulting, but just cold towards me.

There was a party over the weekend at our house we hold every year. I invited some people from work, including the girl in question.  The party was fine, everyone had some drinks.  At the end, a group was leaving to the bar, and I decided to go with, and my wife stayed home.  The girl and I got flirty, and we ended up back at her place around 2am.  We had sex (with protection), and I went home. My wife was upset I was out late, and had tracked my phone. I was drunk, didn't know what to say, and made up a story and fell asleep.  Over the next three days, she kept pressing me on it, telling me she wouldn't be upset, and I finally came clean. I told her everything, and told her it was the truth. She punched me in the eye, and hasn't really been talking to me since.

Now she doesn't believe anything I say, and is accusing me of carrying on a relationship, which is not true.  It truly was a one night mistake.  I want to stay with her, and move forward.

It is very important to me that I train him correctly and make sure he develops to his full potential. So I am trying to figure out my plan of action for training. However I am getting tons of mixed information on how I should train him.

I work a 9-5 mon-fri and my girlfriend is showing up at the house to spend about 30 minutes with him at lunch. She also has days off during the week and works weekends so he will have occasional days off from being stuck at home alone.

**So now my questions**

*First Lets assume money doesn't matter and only this little guys comfort and development does!
*Now that I am at work a few people told me I should crate train him, I was thinking that might be pretty crappy to be locked into a cage all day, but they say it is actually most humane for the dog.. won't he pee and such all over himself? Should I just get a huge kennel that even I could fit in comfortably? Or get a small one and upgrade it as he grows?
*I also have a large open tile area that has a door which I could put a indoor doggy gate and doggy door so he could freely go outback and inside.. I was a little worried about security, but figured I could start with a small doggy door and then upgrade it to larger ones as he grows, at that point no one will want to try to come in anyways :)
*When I put him to sleep last night I put his food and water in the bathroom, I think this is why he pooped and peed so much, I also left the food and water there before I went to work, should I leave him without food and water throughout the night/day and that might get him more sanitary conditions?

There were fights along the way but we worked it out. Once we moved in, we started taking each other for granted a bit. We had a few tough months but we were working on it and getting better. We had a few awful fights though, but worked it out.

At the weekend, we had a big fight. We had both been drinking. Without going into too much detail, as a result of his friend I got angry and shouted at my boyfriend. He broke up with me on the spot, saying he wouldn't take being spoken to like that any more. Anyway he actually took me home, we talked/argued for 2 1/2 hours, but then he walked out at 3am. Since he lives with me, his stuff is here, but he took a bag.

He walked out like that a couple times before but I'd call and we'd work it out. I called him in the morning and we chatted for nearly an hour. He wouldn't come home, but actually we had a nice conversation, and he did tell me he loved me (both during the fight and phone call). I told him that I would give him a few days space. So I haven't spoken to him for three days now.

I've been taking my time and space to use for myself, but obviously I want to talk to him. I have decided I probably want to work on us, because I am in love with him. Do you have any advice for me regarding - when should I call him? Should I even bother to try to work it out with him? And any advice for how to do that?

One in particular was a slightly older lady and we became pretty good friends, and after several months she sent me nudes (face and everything). One night, 3 years ago, she suggested we masturbate on webcam. I agreed, and so we did. For the most part, I was careful about showing my face, but did show it for probably 10 seconds. Her face was in it the whole time.

After we finished, we talked like usual. I knew she had done this with others in the past (told me it was a fetish of hers). So I asked her whether she was ever worried that she would be recorded and posted online. She then told me that she records all of her encounters as a counter measure. That obviously worried me and I told her I really wasn't comfortable with her having recorded it. I also told her that I had deleted her nudes after I looked at them as I didn't feel right keeping them. She apologized profusely and said she deleted it.

We kept in touch for a few months after that, but I slowly cut off communication as I kind of resented her for the fact that she recorded me without telling me.

Now, I know she said she deleted it. I guess my fear comes from the fact that I'll never know if she deleted it. The first month after it happened was the worst for me. I was pretty scared. After that I pretty much forgot about it and only recently thought about it again. I could probably get in touch with her if I wanted to, but not sure if that's a good idea. She never threatened me or anything, but I'm still worried. 

Any thoughts or advice? I guess I'm scared that it might pop up on the Internet 10+ years from now. Maybe I have anxiety issues? I've been known to dwell over things for a long time. For example, over the last week, I've been thinking about this almost constantly. Oh and yes, I definitely learned my lesson.

I recently heard of the term ""unicorn"" and ""unicorn hunting"" but I just want to clarify that I will not be part of this lifestyle. This is her own secondary relationship to keep herself happy and exhilarated with the beauty of the female body.

Is this wrong? Are we ""unicorn hunters"" if I am not part of this? What would we call my wife's lifestyle?

1104, I told my wife that I didn't want to dig through a pile of used towels at the gym to find my swimsuit and she got pissed at me for not wanting to get a fungus on my balls.,"So, at the gym today in the men's locker room, I had my Speedo wrapped in a towel to dry when I tossed in the very large bin of used towels. 2 minutes later i realized what i did, but by that time at least 5 other guys had thrown their towels into the bin... and the bin was already about half full. There was no way that I was going to go digging through dozens of wet or sweaty towels that have been on the floor, on random genitals, and on strange ass bits.

So I told my wife this story expecting a laugh and she looked at me incredulously because I DIDN'T go digging through the nasty heap towels. Then she started talking down to me like I was an paranoid germaphobe who was being completely unreasonable. Whaaaa?

I told her that you could get fungus, warts, staph and a whole strain of other infections from this sort thing and she just told me that I should wash my hands afterwards.

Am I wrong? Should I have dug through a bin of used gym towels to find my stupid swimsuit?

1105, Ive been emotionally cheating on my girlfriend and feel like a bastard for doing so. Is it normal for a young male to have wandering eyes and how can i keep my wandering eyes in check and stay with the one i love?,"Forgive me for my shitty grammar reddit-sama.

           My girlfriend[21F] was going through a rough period recently and she wouldnt tell me what was up. So i was worried and anxious for two days wondering what was up. Finally she wanted to talk about it after blaming it on numerous other things and turns out its her father (nothing new but its not a big deal). I just felt.. empty, out of juice. I couldnt even console her. Im normally very understanding and non-jugdemental but something in my mind said ""im tired of this shit"" and i wanted to break up with her since.

But that's not the biggest issue, i feel like ive been emotionally cheating on her for the past month. Ive been hitting on girls, getting their numbers, and then deleting them essentially. All harmless fun? I feel like my heart is in the wrong place. 

                 This is the only relationship where i haven't cheated and yes im a bastard but im trying here. I constantly check out other girls, and even think about other girls when we are having sex. Is this normal? I feel like im too young to be in a relationship and i dont want to hurt her. I am all she has for support stateside (emotionally not financially) and if i leave her she has basically no-one so i feel as if im abandoning her. I still love this woman and i know in my heart she will be the one that got away. 

                   I just dont know what the right move is because ive never had a good model for a relationship in the first place. Every relationship ive been in resolves the same way but i am admant against cheating on anyone ever again. Is my wandering eye a normal human male thing or am i kidding myself and should i end this? I dont think im built for relationships period but if i were to stay how can i keep my reptilic mind in check and stay focused on the one i love?

Im sorry for being a bastard C.

Being a reasonably hygienic person, I tend to shower from time to time. So on this gloriously rainy and generally disgusting day in Ireland I decided to wash myself before heading to bed, my girlfriend decided she was going to clean our room a bit while I was in the shower which was great.

Fast forward to me being in the shower, soaping it up, having a real good time, when suddenly I hear the most ghastly and terrifying wail I have ever heard in my life. What the fuck is after happening? Images of the wardrobe after falling on my girlfriend flashing through my mind.  I immediately jump out of the shower and hurry to the bedroom (almost slipping) and barge into the room, face alight with worry & concern, boobs bouncing with urgency, shouting ""ARE YOU OK? WHAT HAPPENED?"". My girlfriend turns to me, utterly confused 

Gf : ""What?""
Me: ""I thought I heard you scream. Are you ok?""
Gf: ""Yeah I'm fine, I was just singing.""

Just singing.

We stand silent for a moment allowing what had just happened to soak in, maintaining eye contact. Soapy bubbles dripping from my hair down my body. Mutually embarrassed and equally amused we laugh it off and I return to the shower.

1107," Dad is overweight, has sleep apnea, eats poorly, harps on wife, has a hard time losing weight. What can I do to make him more conscious of his eating habits, and what can I do to support his weight loss (or","Hey loseit! I need a little perspective from some of you amazing people who have found the motivation to get healthy!

My father is in his fifties, quite overweight and has developed sleep apnea, and a stress/boredom eater. He goes to the gym two or three times a week to lift weights, but most of his trouble is in his diet. I think his weight issues are also conflated with boredom at work and dissatisfaction in his marriage. His wife can really harp on him cruelly about his eating habits, so I want to be rational and kind about an already sensitive subject.

This summer I'm back home from school, and I really want to try to make him more conscious of what he eats, but I don't know if having a serious conversation will do it, or if I should just subversively try to clean up the quality of food in the pantry and in our meals, dump nutrition information on him, or...? 

What was the tipping point for you, and what could/did your family do to get you there or support you? What was insulting, upsetting, or discouraging? I'm a little worried that there isn't anything I can do at all, that maybe to lose weight there really has to be some internal drive I can't create. I love my dad very much and I want him to be around for a while, and I think he would be so much happier if he had more energy and more ways to cope with life than snacking.

1108," I want to break up with my boyfriend, but he's super clingy and whiny, and I don't want to drag out the inevitable fight that would happen if I did. Help? :(","Let me start with some background information. I'm 18, and about to graduate high school. I've pretty much been in a relationship pretty much ever since seventh grade. Most of them sucked; I've had ONE legitimately good relationship since then. (He and I are best friends, and I'm fairly certain that I will marry him one day.) However, I'm currently dating a guy I met at school. He was cool and everything to begin with, but when we started going out, everything changed. He's whiney, he's controlling, and overall, he's just pathetic. On top of that, he lied to me about how old he was, and didn't tell me 'til after we started dating. (He's 16, just for the record.) We've broken up once before, and my god, was it nasty. He went around telling people that I was using him for money, which I found hilarious, because he didn't even buy me a Valentine's day present ""because he wanted a bird"". Yeah. Anyways, it ended with A: him bringing all my laundry to school SOAKING WET and in a ripped up plastic grocery bag, and B: him screaming at me, in front of our entire first block JROTC class, to go fuck myself. So basically, I did what I always do- I took him back. I've put up with his clingy, childish bullshit for another barely tolerable two months, and I'm tired of it. I'm graduating on June 9th and shipping off to Basic Training on July 3rd (Army, 68W Combat Medic). I'm barely gonna get a ""summer break"" as it is, much less with him supergluing himself to me as usual. I don't want to drag this shit out, but another fight would emotionally ruin me right now.

1110," Cat has problems peeing, vet suggested Feliway, but I don't know where to plug it in, or if it's even worth it.  She's a chill cat, but I want her to pee less.","My poor cat (~1yr old calico) has problems peeing--it might be crystals.  I'm currently working with a vet and changing her diet etc.    One thing that was suggested was Feliway.   

The Vet said that she might not be getting enough water.  This cat drinks more water than any cat I've ever seen, and I was giving her wet food twice a day as well.  Before she was having problems urinating she'd PEE SO MUCH!  Like massive clumps of urine that she'd play with if I didn't scoop them straight away (my kitten is a dirtball).    I'm wondering if maybe she misses me and is drinking less when I'm not around and I'm not really noticing it.  If this is the case I want to try Feliway.  (My mom, a vet tech recommends it as well).  

For my cat's first 7 months with me (she followed me home off the street) I was working from home, this month, I started working a ""real"" job and am away for 9 hours.  I do make an effort to play with her a bit when I get home, but she's such a cuddle bug that we wind up just cuddling and watching TV.   

It's hard to tell if she is stressed with me leaving, because she is SUCH A CHILL LITTLE GIRL.  She's playful at the right times, cuddly when I want her to be, and she's so good at the vet--only slightly ""normal"" nervous.  
I'm not having issues with her peeing outside the box; I just want to make her less stressed.

I feel it was overstepping her bounds.  Who is in the right here,"So I talk to my wifes brothers fairly frequently as we're pretty close.  He seemed a bit odd so I asked how he was.  I could tell something was wrong and he said he was fine.  We talked and I asked how he and his g/f were.  He said things were good.  I replied with ""Hmmm.  Really?""  ""yes, everything is excellent"".  Again I replied with ""For some reason, I don't think you're telling me the truth"".

He confessed they split up and laughed ""You must have some sixth sense"".  My wife was talking to him too (We were on skype with him).  The skype call barely ended when she called her Mom and Dad to sort of weed out if they knew.  She didn't let on but immediately called her sister and told her that he seemed down and started mentioning He changed his FB picture and she wasn't able to find her on his Facebook.  She checked hers and she was gone off her sisters FB too.

Her sister put 2 and 2 together and now knows without my wife DIRECTLY telling her.  

Her take:  She cares for her brother a lot (and she does) and wanted to get them to call him to cheer him up.  She swears she didn't directly tell anyone.  So she's free and clear.

My take:  She never should have called her parents or sister and left it to him to tell them when he was ready.  Now, they're going to ask about it.  I feel it was overstepping her bounds.  She disagrees.

I love him and don't want to lose him because of it.","Ever since I was young I have always been really sexual. When I finally started having sex it became all I wanted to do. The problem is that I have issues dealing with not having it.

For example, if I meet up with my BF and we don't have sex as soon as possible, I find it hard to concentrate on what we are doing. I try to focus but my BF senses it, and then we usually have some sort of argument. I don't want to pressure him into having sex which is what it feels like he feels I'm doing when I'm not all there. 

My BF just isn't in the mood sometimes, and I get that but it doesn't really make it any easier. Especially when he'll say things like ""I jacked off before I came to see you so I'm not in the mood"". That just leaves me thinking he should've thought about my needs, but I don't know how to really talk about this since I don't want to tell him what to do with his body. 

I love him, and I don't see him just as a sex object. It's just so much easier to do things with him if I get my fix. He's so incredible and I feel so connected with him when we have sex. 

How can I talk to him about what I'm feeling without crossing boundaries, and what can I do to get over this need for sex in order to concentrate? I hate that we argue about this because we don't argue about anything else.

There were times we tried walking away, wanting to see other people. When I tried to, he'd start becoming really sweet and playful. When our attempts at dating failed, we just go back to before. A part of me thinks maybe those relationships also failed because we wanted to continue... or not. who knows.

One day, he just blurted to me that he wants to try and ask this other girl out. That broke something in me. I've been unable to sleep since then. I can't stop thinking about him.

It doesn't make much sense. Sex is good but not passionate. We don't cuddle or hug. It's almost transactional. But, he is a good-looking, nice and intelligent. He has been there for me through some tough times. I don't understand why I feel like this.

I went ""I hope one day I can find a guy that nice! Good for Taylor!"" And my dad just went off. I can't remember exactly what he said, but it was along these lines, ""Why would you want to be like her? She's a slutty girl who can't sing! You better not be like her!"" 

He does this EVERYTIME I mention her. My sister had to drive me to her concert because he wouldn't stop being mean. I just want him to stop!

Thank you in advance for any advice.

1124," Brother is a mess, SIL is having a hard time coping with his behavior, and I want to fly him back out here to get a break. He is very paranoid and has made some pretty crazy claims about me. What can I do to help","My sister in law ""Ann"" called me in tears last night and can't cope with my brother ""Tom"" any more. They have two young children and have been married for 16 years. Tom has a masters degree but can't keep a job. He has been diagnosed PTSD but I think there are other serious mental issues going on with him. He has extreme paranoia, has completely white hair, and has zero skills when it comes to money and interpersonal interaction. 

I flew Tom out here a few months ago to give Ann a break and to see for myself. He only stayed a few nights with me, borrowed a lot of money, and changed his flight to go back earlier than we had agreed. We didn't interact much. I definitely have to walk on egg shells around him. We didn't fight but we didn't communicate either.

According to Ann, he is now getting worse. He refuses to admit a problem, his counselor seems to just validate him, and he is a financial black hole. Ann is having to do all the work as mom, dad, and breadwinner.  I asked if she was concerned for her safety and she said yes. But she feels trapped.

I am willing to fly my brother back out here to give my SIL  a break. She said ""At least a month"" I'm not thrilled about inviting chaos into my life. I am a single dad, and have young kids at home full time myself. My brother is very suspicious of me and has made some pretty insane claims that I got him fired from several jobs and that I installed spyware on his computer and track him.

I'm concerned my brother is not able to function in society and is a step away from homelessness. I love him. I don't know how to help. My mom had serious mental health issues, and I housed and provided for her for several years until it destroyed my own marriage and I had to put her in a nursing home. I also cared for my dad until he died of Alzheimer's. I feel like I am the ""responsible"" one and my other siblings are looking to me to step in yet again.

I should point out that this is a long distance relationship, but we have been doing a good job of keeping the distance short. He lives in SC and I live in PA.

Where the issue lies is that he never really seems to take any sort of an interest in what's going on in my life or how I'm feeling. Not to toot my own horn here, but I do make it a point to ask him if he's okay and how he's doing when I can tell somethings up. But he rarely asks me the same. Lat time was 3 days ago and the time before that was nearly a week prior. 

Whenever I do try to tell him about anything that's going on in my life, be it school, family, emotional stuff, whatever, he kind of deflects it. From there he will either do the whole ""Im not enough to keep you happy"" routine and we have a huge argument, or he will give some half assed condolence and then change the topic to something else. 

I've tried talking to him about it and it doesn't seem to sink in. Any help??

1126, Ex broke up with me because of my hobby. She moved away and now we don't speak. Is it possible that she was telling the truth and that's why she broke up with me?,"Please keep politics out of this, I don't care about your views as much you care about mine.

My ex girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me the day before Thanksgiving 2014. Three months prior to this happening, she moved 90 miles away for a job. I was still in school till graduation in May, but we saw each other on the weekends. We had a pretty good relationship, but she came from a very liberal family and I came from the opposite.  

She didn't dislike that I had guns nor did she not trust me with them. I'm a certified pistol and rifle instructor and she knew that I had the proper credentials and training from the start. Hell, I even brought her with me to the range on multiple occasions. However, when she moved away she started hanging out with a crowd that thought themselves to be pretty elite and apparently called me a hillbilly, redneck, etc. She started picking fights with me over little things and it went to hell fast.

When I picked her up to drive her to the airport to fly home, she broke up with me out of the blue. I asked why and she said she hated all my firearms and my activity with them. I was pretty shocked, it was never a problem until then. She said she was embarassed to have a boyfriend who's hobby was so primitive. 

When she said that, I pretty much erased her from my life. Almost a year later, I am fairly certain that her reason was bullshit. We haven't spoken since that day even when I reached out to her to gain some real closure. Totally shut out. 

My question to you is whether that reason is a valid reason to end a relationship? I think not, but I gotta get a second opinion. I do not want this girl back FYI.

Not a real bad one, but it did over $3,000 damage to my car and over $5,000 in medical bills.  I was rear-ended by someone who was rear-ended. The two other cars, I believe, were totaled. On the police report, the person at fault indicated he hit us because he was ""attempting to put his seat belt on"".

I am now called about two to three times a day from the insurance company to settle - they want to give me ""$1,500 to put in my pocket"".

Im not sure who else to turn to, I have have asked my Friends for advice but they don't fully understand my situation.

A little backstory from me, didn't loose my virginity until i was 23, always been a little awkward around girls. I have had 2 girlfriends so far, my first last year, went about 3 months, then i ended it because i didn't see it going anywhere. Then i met my current girlfriend on OKCUpid about 3 months ago, been officially a couple for about 2 of those.

About a month ago, she told me she has Borderline personality disorder, and told me to do research on and figure out if this is something i can get involved in. I told her i wanted to be with her, despite everything. We get along really well, have same interests, have similar goals in life. But there was always one thing lacking in her eyes, and that was sex, now don't get me wrong, the sex we have is great, i get her off a lot. shes just into a lot of stuff i'm not, like having sex with multiple people. and she said she doesn't think she can be with me anymore if we don't start looking into a poly relationship. 

She says she loves me all the time and wants a long term relationship with me, but i'm not sure Morally if i can do that. The thought of her sleeping with someone else is heartbreaking, but also the idea of loosing her is even worse. I feel like no matter what option i choose im fucked. We talked a few hours last night about the possibility of being open like that, and i'm trying my best to adapt but it is hard. Im trying to understand her thought process in all this but its hard to grasp this whole situation. I told her last night i need a day or 2 to think things over and i'm gonna let her know my decision Tomorrow night.

Any advice you guys can give me? There is a lot more i can write up about this situation but i didn't feel like writing a novel, so any any questions let me know. Thanks.

TL;DR: I screwed up a previous relationship,","I realize that I'm probably in the friend zone, but I can't quite tell, because occasionally I get very mixed messages, here's the situation:

I (24M) dated her (23F) in college, and we've just started talking to each other again recently, after I screwed up the previous relationship by cheating on her (not proud of that). I've been going through a kind of hard time at work recently, and we had been talking about that.

When she was upset a few days ago, she called me, because she wanted to talk to me about it, which kind of threw me off a bit. Yesterday, I tried to give her the real apology I always felt like she deserved for me screwing up before, and she said that it meant a lot to her, and then said that she was really happy to have me back in her life, then said that she was really glad that I answered when she called me, because I was the only person she wanted to talk to.

However, despite those things, which would make me think she might be interested in a relationship, she's said a few times now that she wants to be friends. What's going on here?

If so, could such","Conspiracy theories and mysterious organizations like The Illuminati aside (which exist to subvert), could [Cerberus] from the Mass Effect universe exist in the world?  If the organization had humanities best interests at heart and was benevolent in action could such an entity exist that operates outside of traditional law?  Meaning it has it's own government but exists in no particular country but which can also operate in any country without asking for permission from that country.

The thought process that lead up to this was the fact that a separate private entity could mobilize faster to help people when a natural disaster strikes without having to go through the normal legal channels that exist in that country.  Take the Disastrous Gulf Oil Spill as an example, even though a lot of things are being done to resolve the situation it seems as though there is an incredible amount of delay in fixing the issue from beginning to end, everything from the government and organizational level blame to the nitty gritty of the issue, which is action, just seems to be taking an exceptional amount of time for REAL ACTION to take place.

Cerberus, which is a fictional organization from a computer game, with supposedly unlimited funds and run by a guy only known as [The Illusive Man] operates outside of the law but wants to do what's best for humanity.  

Honestly, I think problems in the world can be resolved A LOT quicker than how they are managed currently and it would almost always seem to be the law or some legislation that gets in the way of a timely resolution.

So say there were some billionaire in todays world that *truly* had access to unlimited resources, could such a person create this organization similar in outward appearance to Cerberus and actually help humanity without conceding to any nations laws, as long as they were benevolent?

1133, I spent most of my life on computer games and disregarded my father who was always there for me. I realized my mistake after losing contact with my father. I feel like I wasted my life and I feel bad for not spending more time with my,"Today I realized I fucked up by disregarding my father.

**backstory** : 

   First, I was born in South Korea and during my childhood ( birth - 2nd grade), my father constantly flied back and forth to U.S.A and Korea. I don't have any memories of any bonding time with him due to that reason. 

   We later decided to move into USA for better living conditions. My father would mostly be at work and I would only see him for about 10-15 minutes a day. Because I wasn't fluent in english,  I didn't make as many friends in school and at home, I usually played game on the computer. It went to the point that I became completely reliant on the computer for entertainment and became addicted to games. Due to those factors, I became a stereotypical asian who spends his whole day on a computer.

   Fast foward to 2/1/2015, my father recently lost his job but found a job in a different state( 1-2 hours from where i currently live). He cannot commute frequently so he will live in that state. Realizing that this meant I would see him 1-2 times a month (if I'm lucky), I felt remorseful about the times I didn't spend with him that I spent on games. 

  I learned what it meant when other people say you should value your friends/family more until you realize they are gone. I know he is not completely gone from me in any sort of way but, it is heartbreaking to face the fact that 16 years and 9 months of my life have been unresponsively spent when I could have hung out with my dad more often.

We are I believe what you would call a ""casual relationship"" that is making me insane. Somehow he behaves more rudely than anybody I ever met before (he drops me at the railway-station without even asking whether he should wait with me for the train, when we walk through a crowd he sometimes walks 10m in front of me without taking my hand, because at some point I said I prefer reducing PDAs, he purposefully ignores me).

2. he's playing games

I do not believe that he's not interested, because he would have the possiblity of FWB with me and we have rather trouble filling our time with things we mutually enjoy (I like artsy movies and sports, he likes to smoke and drink). Sex is really good and I generally get good feedback from him. So it must be him playing games.

He would do things like not meeing me for two weeks, when definitely having the options (he has a car and would have to drive 45 minutes)
to do so, and during the period calling (for three days every day for an hour and then for four days nothing, and not responding to my calls and calling back much later). 

Since I questioned him about his mental sanity (twice) and he assured me that he believes to be sane, I assume he's playing games. What should I do? I like him and sex with him, I don't believe us to have a lot of potential for a serious long-term relationship, because he destroys his body with poinson. However, his games make me think about him constantly and make me want him. Am I the crazy one?

1142," landlord refused to give us a written rental history for the year we lived there, and now we have to pay a large deposit because of it.  Can we get a written rental history of our apartment in the future, or is there any other way","Hi /r/legaladvice!  

My husband and I lived in an apartment owned by a private management company from August of 2014, and our lease ends in August 2015.  The apartment was located in Osceola County, FL and was in a smaller historic building.  We never had any contact with the company itself, only the building manager.  Rent was always paid on time/early.

Because it would have been more expensive to break our lease rather than let it run it's course, we moved out about a month ago but paid rent through the end of the lease.  When it came time to sign on our current apartment, we provided the new complex with our previous building manager's contact info.  New complex sent an email to building manager, asking for an email from him verifying we had been tenants and paid on time.  Building manager instead called the new complex, and gave a verbal recommendation.  According to the leasing agent, he declined to offer a written rental history for us, and refused to give a reason.  The leasing agent said this was the first time he'd had that happen to prospective tenants.

I called the building manager and requested a written rental history, or just an email confirming we had been there for a year and weren't behind.  He declined, saying he needed approval from the board of the management company to issue one.  When asked what the timeline was on that, he hung up.  He has not responded to any communication since then, except to tell us he was declining a final walkthrough of the apartment with us.

We ended up having to pay as much of a deposit as someone with zero rental history ($500 more, only half refundable).

We had gotten back in contact after I'd texted that I was distracted when we dated and wanted to meet up. He agreed because wanted to give things another shot because he said he dumped me because I didn't seem interested enough when we dated the first time, like that I wasn't engaged enough during dates, never initiated plans, etc. (which was valid considering I was dating two people at once and was depressed then).

Now that we've been seeing each other again for a few months, he's been distant this time. He's been unemployed for 6 months and I know he's forgetful and lazy as a result of depression. Like he'll go along with things but doesn't initiate anymore in the last month. I'm showing him I'm interested like he wanted but he's been distant. Confused because why would he be distant if I'm showing interest if that was the supposed problem?

1145, Girlfriend and I have been dating for a year and she moved across the country and now has started to lose feelings for me and I don't know if it is normal for me to feel this way or if it is the end of us.,"My girlfriend and I have been friends for over 3 years and recently started dating about a year ago.  Slightly before we started dating she had decided to move across the country with her roommate.  Despite that we still both ended up developing feelings for one another and have had an amazing time dating for the past year and before she left we had agreed to attempt to have a long distance relationship until she comes back (She decided to probably move back in may).  However the past month of her being gone my anxiety is getting hard to handle with her consistently meeting other guys off of tinder in an effort to make friends, and frequently goes out drinking and partying with them.  It has gotten to the point now where i feel she has lost all feelings for me. She never texts back, is generally unpleasant during phonecalls, will abruptly leave without any form of compassionate goodbye, and gets angry anytime I mention this to her.  We were friends before this and I really would like to date her if she moves back again.  Is this something that is just a problem with myself not trusting her enough and completely normal?  Or is this the beginning of the end for us?

We drop off everyone and it's me, A and B. A is extremely sick and starts vomiting everywhere so we have to drop her off at her house.  So now it's me and B alone in the car just talking about whatever. Now I have never really been interested in B and I've seen her a couple of times but never caught my eye.

Fast forward after A left out of state. B starts texting/snapping me on the daily and she said ""even though A left, we still better hang out"". She'll send me selfies with her dog and all that kind of stuff. After texting around , I find we have a lot of things in common.

I was on my way to work and will not lie, I pass by a school that I disregard the ""school zone"" speed limit for.  This is mainly because it take only about 0.1 or 0.2 miles until I pass the school zone.  Once past the school zone you're allowed to resume 35-40 mph.  Obviously when you are in the school zone it's supposed to be 25 mph.  

I was picked up for going 41 in a 25 zone.  There's no debating it.  I was compliant and cordial to the officer to avoid any chance of confrontation.  The end result?  A $54 dollar fine for having license plate holder that is not legal in my state.  He stressed he could have given me 6 points for speeding in a school zone though.  Told me where I could go to dispute it and that we can tell the judge how I could be possibly dangerous to the children of the school, including the judge's grandson.  

Part of me wanted to argue that I was just out of the school zone.  The other part is thankful that this guy did not throw 6 points at me?

Is it unreasonable for me to want more contact time with him (and less time with his bros)?","Hello gamers! I (20) am the devoted girlfriend of a gamer (24), and let me clarify this first: I have absolutely no problem with him gaming. (I actually prefer gamers vs. non to date.) I used to game when I was younger, so I can understand the appeal.

Anyway, my boyfriend informed me last minute that he would be hosting a two week long LAN at his house. This means limited contact (except for a few messages informing me that he is still alive) and he pretty much refuses to have a phone conversation with me because he is with his bros and it is always a ""bad time"". 

Two days before this, he just finished a week-long camping trip with his other (male) friends.

So my question to you is: how much time should be allotted to gaming when one has a girlfriend? Do you think it should increase/stay the same/decrease when one is attached? I understand the importance of male camaraderie, but is it unrealistic for a woman to want her boyfriend to slow down on the ""bro time""?

So I called him and broke it off, explaining that it wasn't him, there just was something missing on my part. 

He basically begged me to give him another chance, blamed the sex, kept asking what I did wrong. And I'm still getting texts from him even though I asked him to leave me alone. 

Finally I deleted him from social media and he sent me some text messages flipping out at me and telling me that I didn't give him a chance and was a liar. 

I don't know what to do from here. I thought I did the right thing by not wasting any more of his time. I guess I just stop replying now and let it fizzle out? Been about 3 weeks now since I dumped him.

Reddit, please help me out. Here's the story. My boyfriend's parents are getting a divorce because his dad has been cheating on his mom with another woman via the Internet for over a year. They broke the news to my bf the day before his birthday. I know, right? Pitiful. His dad is a scumbag, I've never liked him. My bf doesn't like his dad either. 

Anyway, his dad called him today to tell him that he and his new woman are getting married in JUNE, and they asked if we could go. Of course, my bf absolutely does not want to go, and since his father doesn't have any friends, he'd probably end up being his best man, or at least one of his groomsmen. But here's the catch- his father pays his phone bill, car fixes, and car insurance, and my bf is afraid his dad will cut him off financially if he doesn't go (although my bf pays his way through school, pays his own rent, pays for his food, lives in a whole other state than his parents, manages to support himself). Is that irrational for him to think that his dad might cut him off if he doesn't go to his wedding? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

Basically, for the past 5 months I have lived around an hour away from my boyfriend (before that we were living in the same city). We see each other every weekend, with me traveling down to see him more often than the other way round. I'm fine with this, he lives in a nicer city and I get to visit friends.

He is in a band and has been since a year or so before we got together, it makes him really happy and that's cool. They often play gigs and I'll normally go along and watch. 

For my 21st birthday, my parents said they will pay for me and him to go on holiday (this was in October). I've been waiting for him to give me dates that we can go, hopefully around March time, so I can book it and get time off work. He has come up with tonnes of dates that he is doing band stuff and still no solid date that we can go anywhere. I also asked if we could put a bit of extra money towards what my parents offered so we could go somewhere nicer, and he said he can't afford it which is fine.

This brings me to my problem: he just dropped it on me that he is going to be paying £600 to record some songs with his band in March time. I'm pretty upset by this, as it seems that the band is clearly his priority and that he can't be bothered with this holiday. The only other issue I've really had is that he didn't get me a birthday present and I know that I can be difficult to choose things for and he didn't have much money at the time so I let it go.

Am I wrong to be upset? I don't want him to stop being in a band because it makes him really happy and I enjoy going to see them play, but it seems a bit worrying that he can drop this much money on something when he 'has no money' etc.

Any advice on how to deal with the situation would be great.,"I know this is hardly as big a problem that others on this sub are having but i just need some advice on this.

Ive been going out with this girl who i absolutely adored for the longest time beforehand. I was so stoked when she said she would go out with me. The first couple of months were great, we spent a lot of time together and we got (and still do) along really well. 

But one thing that has really stood out is the physical side of the relationship. Shes a really attractive woman who has a lot going for her, but in the year we have been going out except maybe the first few months the sexual part of our relationship has pretty much died. We dont flirt, we dont make out, we dont have sex or any intimacy in a physical sense. Its like we're just friends. And i hate it. 

And its not like we've been without opportunites, there have been times when the stars have aligned and everything is perfect for a night of intimacy. And after a few kisses its ""Not tonight"" or literally just rolling over and sleeping. 

I just dont understand it. Ive asked her why we never have a physical side to our relationship anymore. She just says ""Im just a bit timid"" or ""we just dont have time"". But we've been together for so long now that is just doesnt make sense. If she said to me that she doesnt like having sex, or she worried about how she looks or any number of plausible reasons then I could work with them. But she just brushes it off.

A couple of months ago a good mutual friend of ours said to me that me and her weren't really in a relationship and that we were really just good friends with a formal label smacked on it. 

And thats exactly what it feels like really.

I guess im just confused, i really like her but after all this time with no physical or even emotional reciprocation, I guess you'd say no romance I just don't want to be in this kind of relationship.

My breathing and posture is affected in a pathological and unending manner, do a degree that I wasn't aware of til recently.

I have been meditating and realized that my left ribs are also causing cascading pain patterns around the spine on the right side, primarily from T 8 to C 0, at a pain level of 2-5 at all times.

I am wondering if I am a candidate for surgery, or if there is anything that I can do to structurally support that area so that the left side of my body can become strong again. I am in a lot of pain and feel fragile and uncomfortable in my body. I also have depression which may partly come from learned disassociation from my body.

I am going to a Osteopath next Wednesday, and any ideas that anyone has would be appreciated. I'd also like to ask them some of the right questions and make sure I'm providing any information I can go help them. Thank you!

1164," Boyfriend would love to have 5 kids, but I only want 3. He is ok with 3, but I worry that number will change after having kids. Should I be worried and how certain were you of the number before having kids?","We have been dating for two years and basically living together from about 1 month in. He is a wonderful fellow and, besides one or two areas of communication we need to work on, I am immensely happy with our relationship. We have had many conversations on financial views, personal goals, career paths, in-laws and, of course, children.

   Now I work with children and have enjoyed a large role in the lives of my niece and nephew, so I feel I may have some idea of the stresses of having children. However, I am pretty sure that my expecations won't fully prepare me for the reality and it will certainly be an adventure.  I have always assumed I would probably have 1 or 2 kids.

  My boyfriend would love nothing more than having a passle of children - in his mind 5 would be wonderful. For him, more kids means more grandkids and he seems to love the idea of being a grandfather covered in grandkids. Adorable to me but seems rather unrealistic. When we have discussed this, I have made it clear that 3 children is a compromise for me and that number seems to satisfy him - but he doesn't like the idea of having any fewer.
  
However, I worry (and I have told him this) that the number will change for me after I push out a kid or two. I don't think he truly realizes how exhausting, demanding and expensive having children can be. I am afraid of making that promise. I don't us to settle down only to find that either I am unhappy with a passle or he is disappointed with only a pair. 

  For the redditors that have children, how certain were you of the number before you had them? Should I be worried about this uncertainty and discrepancy in our desires?

1165, I have a girlfriend and a girl who I slept with once (who is now out of the picture) is in my class and I compare myself to her constantly and it is causing problems with my relationship with my girlfriend.,"This is a weird situation.  []

So me [M17] and my girlfriend [F17] have been going out for a year and 6 months now. We have always been happy together and well suited and the only major hitch we ever had is that I slept with another girl last summer (please let me explain as this situation needs serious contextualisation)...

Summer 2014 aged 15 I met a girl (lets call her Anna) the same age as me. Anna and I got off every now and again and eventually we went out for maybe 5 or 6 months.

Winter 2014 everything was becoming too much and so to get out of the relationship I had sex with another girl who was one year above me (she was 17 I think at this point). Anna is now out of the picture as far as I am concerned

Spring 2015 I asked out my current girlfriend (both of us aged 16) and things were very good for both of us.

Summer 2015 my girlfriend went on holiday. I went to a party and got completely shitfaced and ended up sleeping with Anna (likely to get back at me for cheating on her). Went on a break with girlfriend and had to work very hard to get her back.

Summer 2015-Present: Anna now goes to my school and is in my biology class. She is a girl who goes out a lot and does a lot of drugs, she has slowly but surely slipped further and further behind as I excelled as one of the best in the class. She too has a boyfriend in the same year (17) however I think that he is far too good for her and that is what has gotten me thinking about how often I compare myself to her.

In conclusion: why is it that I compare this girl to myself and constantly want to be better than her? My girlfriend notices it also and finds it weird and so do I.

Any help would be massively appreciated.

1167," GF's family is poor, uneducated, and has a small town mentality. They have a tendency to take advantage of others, and I don't trust them with a key to our apartment (or even with the spare key to the extra bedroom).","My girlfriend and I live together in a two bedroom apartment near the college that we both attend. Her family is big, with 9 kids, and very poor. They all grew up in a very small town and have what I would consider a ""small town mentality"". They're uneducated, ignorant, and seem helpless when they're not in their small hometown. Many of them are perfectly nice, but it's quite difficult to hold a conversation with anyone in her family; I can't relate to them at all (which can be difficult, as you might imagine).

My main issue with them is trust. Once in a while she'll have one of her sisters come and stay in our extra bedroom, which is fine. My issue is that I feel worried leaving them here alone, or with a key to get in when I'm not around. I come from a family that's well-off, and I have a lot of rather nice things in my apartment. I don't *think* that anyone in her family would steal from us, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they did, or invited someone over who did. They aren't street-smart at all, which is a whole different issue.

How do I deal with this? Am I wrong to worry when one of my GF's sibling is staying here? I don't want to mention it to my girlfriend, as it would probably make her feel ashamed of her background, or mad that I don't trust her family.

TL;DR: my best friend refuses to get rid of","Here's the situation. I live in a house that my husband and I are buying. My best friend lives with us and pays rent. He has lived with me for many years, even before my husband and I were together. We generally all get along. The problem is my best friend's cat. I've found a new home for my cat because his cat was terrrorizing it. My best friend has told me straight up that he will move out if I ask him to get rid of the cat. But the cat has destroyed my couches (not declawed) among many other pieces of furniture, and shits and vomits in our floor every day. He goes in the litter box AND he shits in the front dining room, the office, the kitchen, whereever he pleases. The problem is, with the economy the way it is, we cannot afford to live in our house if my best friend moves out. So its like we are being held hostage by this cats behavior. My best friend refuses to do anything about it. Every day he has a new excuse. He calls the shitting ""accidents"" when it is clearly just a behavior problem that we've accepted for over 3 years now and will not go away. I've bought the spray that you spray where you don't want the cat to go, it doesn't work. We've tried to lock the cat in my best friends bedroom, he gets out. Not to mention the fact that my best friends' girlfriend's puppy is now living with us and has pissed and shit so much on our futon in the guest room that it is ruined. But that's another subject. What do I do? I am so close to just moving into an apartment and waiting for the house to be foreclosed on - but my husband doesn't want to do that.

I don't know if it's a psychological trick or if it's actually possible to eat less when you focus on something else, but it works for me.","Aside from the standard stuff I've seen around here, like drinking water or filling up on really dense/low calorie food, I've realized a method that works for me to avoid feeling hunger pangs.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry. I still browse the internet and watch TV probably a similar amount, but it's when I have free time and when I also do something else: play videogames.

I instinctively looked up her flight on flightaware.com, and looked at the flight plan. She was flying into Reagan National which is especially interesting to me considering all the restricted airspace around it. I decided to impress her with my findings. I told her at how many feet should would be flying, cruising, what waypoints they would hit, what she could see out her window, and what gate she would be pulling up to. Instead of being interested and thinking it was cool like I played in my head, I completely creeped her out. She told me that was boarder line stalkerish, it was weird I knew all that, and frightening that I took the time to look it up. Welp, that about shuts that door forever.

1171, I have a problem with trusting my girlfriend because of what happened before we were official. She did something tonight that made me question our relationship and I don't know if I can enjoy my holidays because of it.,"Okay before I start this, I know that I'm only 19 and 6 months is nothing. We both full of ourselves and think that we're too mature to have relationship problems because relationship problems are for kids who don't know what they're doing or for adults who actually have problems. Unfortunately, we're not as smart as we think we are. 

Background - We started off as friends with no intention of ever being together until one night that changed everything. Feelings were spilled yadda yadda. We didn't want to take it too seriously because we're barely adults and we know that we don't know the first thing about a real relationship. Plus we hated labels so we just refused to say we were together even though we hung out all the time, texted all the time, went on dates and stuff. A couple months into our ""relationship"" (still unlabeled at the time), she ""cheated"" on me. Now, we weren't official so I wasn't mad. Still I was hurt and she felt bad. After that point we realized that we cared about each other too much for this kind of shit to happen again. We slapped a label on it and have been exclusive ever since. 

So things have been going great, my parents love her, all this good shit until I leave to visit family for the holidays while she stays home. I have this problem with trusting her because of what happened before, even though it was ""different"" because we weren't officially together. Still there's not a ton of trust. I have reason to believe that she might've done something tonight that I would not approve of.

I haven't been able to enjoy my holidays because I keep thinking about her and it's getting in the way of family. This part is important. 

I'm beginning to realize that I'm not getting to the point. Maybe I don't know what my point is. Maybe I'm too immature to know what I really want. Point is...

If not, is there","Hi, personal finance!  I have read the breakdown provided on the side about IRAs and have researched the difference between the two, and still can't find a straight answer on my dilemma.  

So the current situation is this:  I am 28 years old and I made $95,000 last year.  My job has a $50,000 base salary then the rest is commission based.  I currently have loans to pay (auto and school), I have an emergency fund, and a comfortable amount of cash in my checking account.

SO - I know now is a good time to start saving for retirement.   Based on my income, and the implications of being able to withdraw tax free in my retirement, the Roth seems the obvious choice.  

However, I keep making more and more.  And should I hit my goals this year I will be above the income limit for a Roth ($116,000).  So my question is - Should I open the Roth now with the knowledge that I may be over the threshold this year or within a couple years?  Will I be shooting myself in the foot by then having two separate IRAs. Can they be combined?  If not will I have hypothetically a Roth worth for example $10,000 from late 20s and then a traditional as I grew into a higher salary?  I have heard of back door contributions  - is this the answer?

1174," Fiance's mother wants a key to the hot tub at my house, but I don't want to give her a key to show up whenever she wants.  Is there a way to tactfully shoot this down?

He moved in two weeks ago.

I like my privacy. I like walking around naked after my shower and dancing in my undies in the kitchen while I make breakfast, and eating ice cream straight from the tub while I watch sad episodes on Netflix, and all kinds of other things I don't want my in-laws to walk in on.

So, when my soon-to-be mother-in-law texted saying:

""Hi X, I tried calling earlier, wanted to use the hot tub. You should make us an extra key please. :) ""

""Sorry I missed your call, I was out to lunch! And I haven't been up for guests much lately, but you can always call and if it's a good time you're definitely welcome to come on over!""

She responded:

""I understand! But you seem very busy so it would probably be hard to find a good time. If you made us a key that way it wouldn't interfere with your schedule.""

She then texted again a while later saying, ""If you don't have an extra copy handy, we can pick up [fiance's] key and make a copy of it so you don't have to go to any extra trouble! Let me know when I could stop by.""

I thought about giving them a key with the requirement that they knock first, but in addition to liking my privacy when I'm already at home, I happen to like my privacy when I show up at home, as well.  I want to be able to walk into my own space at the end of the day and not worry about unexpected guests. I really don't want to give them a key to show up whenever they want.

How much should I spend on my CC, I've seen online that more than 30% or more than 50% of your limit as balance can reduce or slow your score, but the amount varies website to website.

I intend to pay off the CC by direct debit from my current account and never let it gather interest. I currently have enough savings and room in my budget that I am not worried about doing this. Is it best to put a small monthly payment like Netflix on it (~£7). Should I put Netflix on the CC and a few small transactions?

I have a vague plan than if I can build decent credit for the next 6-10 months I may be able to find a small card with a period of 0% interest to take me to my first paychecks.

But this little girl... we think she needs more stability. We think she needs some friends, some socializing, running water, pre-school, a bed, to not be surrounded by pot plants all day long in the middle of nowhere.  She already seems very lonely without friends at their current house.  I'm aware that children can thrive in all kinds of conditions, and they should be with their parents... but this seems like a new low for standard of living, and we're having a hard time accepting it.

My husband is talking with his family (parents 60s/m-f, sister 38/f), none of whom like what's going on, but nobody knows what should be done.  His parents are considering taking the daughter ""temporarily, until you get settled"", they live about 20 hr drive away from the reservation.  Do you think that we should force this?  I keep thinking, *well... what if I wanted to spend a summer driving around in a motor home, that wouldn't be completely unreasonable to do with my family...* And I can appreciate camping and living simply and off the grid... but this just seems completely unsafe and irresponsible to us.  She is very stubborn and the type who will cut off contact if we don't go along with her, but we are also trying to figure out at what point we need to have an intervention.

1183, I love my wife but sometimes I don't and I don't know if I really want to leave her but I don't want to be alone and I don't want my kids to grow up without a dad. What do I do...,"I love my wife ... I think. I honestly couldn't tell you anymore if I do or not. I know I love my family and my life and sometimes that's enough but sometimes it isn't . 

First I am not sure if I really want to leave her or not . When we are fighting It is sometimes all I can think about but I am angry and I try not to make decisions when I am angry. Then when everything is going alright I weigh the pros and cons of leaving and I always end up settling on staying but very rarely because I love my wife .

I don't like the idea of not being a dad everyday. We have two children ages [10 f] and [5 m] and I love being with them everyday so I don't Know if I could handle being an every other weekend dad ( not that there is anything wrong with that). Joint custody would be great but I think would be very hard to get my Wife to agree to.

Also financially it is terrifying I already don't make a huge amount of money so adding child support onto that I would be able to afford an efficiency apartment and that's about it. 

I also have absolutely no support I am estranged from my family for reasons to long to get into here but even if i wasn't I am the most well off of any of them so they simply wouldn't be able to afford to help.

lastly I am not even sure if leaving is really what I want. Yes, when things are bad they are VERY bad, not physical but definitely my own personal version of hell. However when things are good the are OK not great but after almost 12 years OK is all I ask. I don't want to leave just to find out that being alone or with someone else isn't what I want either. I am just kind of lost

But in the middle of buttering the first babel a roach comes jumping out of the toasted flying at me, he then lands on the counter and starts his retreat. I run and grab my shoe by the front door and after many back and forths I finally hit him hes dead.

Is there a way to talk to him about it, or is","We moved in about a month ago because we have a baby due in July and wanted to save money/have the baby surrounded by family. (My mother, her bf, two younger sisters and a brother live there together)

My bf hasn't had family he enjoyed being around in a long time, and has always wanted a big family, so he was super stoked to move here. 

He gets along great with my family, thoroughly enjoys their company. But.... 

I feel like myself and the baby have been put on the back burner. He isn't talking about the baby as much, we don't spend any time together- just the two of us, unless it's ridiculously late and we are going to bed. 

Almost all of my attempts at intimacy have been shot down, because he just hasn't been in the mood, which would be fine if I didn't feel like he doesn't want to go off with me because he's worried he will miss out on fun family time. 

I already told him I've felt a little neglected, like he was too busy to hang out with me. He said ""I haven't been ignoring you, we just haven't wanted to do the same things."" Which I guess is true. 

I know I've pulled back some from group activities (mostly because I'm STILL in retrograde with Mercury) because I've been feeling fairly negative lately. (If you can't say somethin' nice, don't say nothin' at all,etc) 

I assume that once the ""new"" wears off he will want to spend more time alone with me. I don't really know if I can approach him again about this, because he isn't really doing anything ""wrong"".

1186," my friend is being sued, but the plaintiff's lawyer is a douche who forwards emails to the opposing lawyer. What can my friend and his lawyer do at this point to get the case dismissed or get the guy disbarred (or at least","Short answer: Obviously pretty bad

Long answer: Curious to see what r/legaladvice thinks of this guy: my friend is currently a defendant in a civil action. It sounds like a pretty frivolous lawsuit, and he has a good lawyer. Problem is that the plaintiff's lawyer is pretty awful - he's had his law license suspended twice by the state board for incompetence.

Also, he doesn't have emotional control of his client. The evidence came in the form of an email that was *forwarded to my friends lawyer by the opposing (plaintiff's) lawyer*. That's right, an actual email, private conversation, between the plaintiff and his counsel... forwarded to the defendant's lawyer.

My question - this is obviously unethical, but is there anything my friend (defendent) or his attorney do at this point? Obviously, my friend wants this civil claim to go away as quickly as possible and he's considered telling the plaintiff that he should consider getting a real attorney. One that doesn't chase ambulances and forwards private emails.

1187," I met a guy at work, hung out with him and his friend, and now we're going to see a movie tomorrow. I don't know if he's interested, and I don't know if I should be forward with my feelings.","The past month I've been working weekends at a haunted house in my area. I started talking to one of the guys I work with and as the weeks have gone by we started talking more before / after work. Last weekend he offered to give me a ride home (I had been taking a cab because I don't have a car or a friend to drive me), and we ended up hanging out from 12am - 7am. 

We originally wanted to see a movie that we thought was at 2:15am. While we waited we went to his house and played video games, then went to the theatre and found out we were wrong about the movie. So we spent a good half hour just sitting in his car in the parking lot chatting away, then we drove around and kept talking. 

At some point during the night we brought up how we generally are friends with someone before dating them. We did a lot of talking about relationships and such, which is why I think he may be interested. A couple of times we would veer off into another topic and he would all of a sudden bring it back to relationships. 

Then we went on a walk through the park which lasted a few hours. By the time we were on our way back to his house, we were both pretty cold (he forgot a sweatshirt and mine wasn't helping too much) so he latched onto me so we wouldn't freeze. We stayed like that the rest of the time, only switching sides a couple of times. 

The next night when he drove me home we ended up sitting in my driveway for roughly 45 minutes to an hour, until he was getting yelled at to come home. I got his number before he left and we spent the majority of yesterday texting back and forth. 

We made plans to see a movie tomorrow, he has a friend coming along as well. 

My problem is I don't want to seem too forward, but I don't want to seem like I'm not interested. So far he seems like a really cool guy. And  I want to know if it seems like he's even interested. My instincts say yes, but I'm not an expert.

Yes, so I snooped. I was definitely curious to see what kind of things he would be blogging about. I figured maybe some Doctor Who, maybe some Fallout things, and I got something that was way, way different.

He's never posted anything, but all the blogs he follows are fringe fetish blogs. Like, chicks pooping in the woods, naked grannies, that sort of stuff.

And then I clicked to see the posts that he's liked and they're all scat, elderly-women related and I would think that maybe this was just kind of a prank set up by some hilarious friend but in the few posts I scrolled past I also saw an Arrested Development gif so it's obvious that he's liking these things himself.

Anyone have any tips on how to deal with the situation,"To summarize a much longer story, I'm working a fairly well paying job that isn't necessarily in my native area.  I've had a career setback recently that was largely outside of my control, and I'm working back up to where I want to be.  

In the meantime, I handle marketing and online aspects for a company in an industry I'm not necessarily socially aligned with.  I do my job well, but finding any socially common ground with much of my co-workers or their colleagues in other companies has been something that's always been a struggle for me.

I'm typically a very confident and well spoken person, but I've found that I've largely frozen up here.  I've found it extremely difficult to really converse with anyone here without feeling like an outcast or feeling somewhat ostracized.  I've noticed that I've adapted by changing my personality a bit where I'm far more inward and withdrawn than I've ever been.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?  I feel like it's becoming a huge problem for me the more it goes on, but I really have no idea how to tackle it as I share literally nothing in common with the people that I work with and I feel almost at times as if I'm from an entirely different country or any planet.

TL;DR: I have a super friendly","Here's the deal:
Three months ago, I took in a cat that was scheduled to be euthanized at a local shelter.  She was older (about 12), and super emaciated, but I totally fell for her personality and wanted to give her a second chance.  

She is an awesome cat.  She's super friendly and people-oriented, basically follows me from room to room, loves to sit on my lap, and sleeps with me every night.  Great cat for someone who wants a constant companion.

BUT

She turned out to have some sort of intestinal disorder (probably either irritable bowel syndrome or intestinal lymphoma, but we can't tell without biopsies).  It caused chronic diarrhea, and was probably part of the reason she was so emaciated.  For some reason, she also can't eat dry food - she vomits every time, but doesn't have problems with wet food.

Now, all four of my roommates insist that I can't keep her (we're moving into a no pets apartment, and the roommates really don't like her).  I need to find her a new home ASAP.
She's doing much better, her diarrhea is under control with steroids/antibiotics, and she's gaining weight.  She is still very skinny, though.  

I can't take her back to the shelter.  I also have doubts about adoption agencies (even ones that take senior/sick cats), because they all seem to be filled with kittens right now.

Anyone have any advice?  Optimistically, does anyone know someone in the SF bay area interested in a special needs cat?

I really don't want euthanasia to be an option, she's so nice, and her quality of life is good.

Should I stick it out and hope for the best, or move on and try to find someone who loves me more","I'm not even sure how to articulate this all to you, or even where to start. We met a year ago and have been inseparable. He's [m/26] absolutely amazing, and treats me [f/23] very well. We have normal relationship problems, but that goes without saying. 

My biggest issue lately, is that he says he loves me, but can't bring himself to say it unless I do. He gets nervous when I say it, I can see it in his body language and demeanor. He says he wants to take things really slow, so I've taken a step back.

Here's how he's confusing me:

He went and got a dog, but he took me with him to get him. He refers to said dog as ""our dog"". May not seem like a big deal, but these are mixed signals to me. 

I've been staying with him for two months since my roommate is in a very rigorous grad school program and is very stressed out at all times and the negativity started taking a toll on me. It's been ""our house"", ""our neighbors"", ""our chores"" etc...

He even asked if I would move across the country with him if he decided to take another job.

Bottom line is, we've talked about how much stronger my feelings are for him than his are for me, and he says he might ""get there one day"", but the fact that I love him enough to marry him tomorrow if he asked, and the love I feel for him is not reciprocated breaks my heart everyday. 

All I want is the feel like someone loves me. I was always told that if you don't feel like someone is giving you the love you need, meet that person with all the love you can muster, and it will all come together. So all I can do is just be there for him, and show him how I feel every day. 

I can't pull myself out of this depression though. Do I stick around, hoping that one day I'll be loved by the person I love the most, or do I leave out of self respect and give myself a chance at something that might have more of a balance?

My cousin and I were close once but she started demanding way too much from me and gets upset whenever I don't do what she wants. After spending a lot of time here, I realize she's a narcissist and so is her mom. It's always about her and what she wants. Never any consideration for my feelings.

Anyway, I was supposed to do day after Christmas shopping with her; picking her up and we drive around to different shops. She insisted on smoking in my brand new car that I just got in October. I told her I'd prefer not since I want to keep that as a nonsmoking car, whether if it's cigarettes or pot. Plus she has a tendency to drop the blunt, she burned a hole in my other car which is why I didn't want to smoke in the car at all. She wouldn't let it go even though I said she could smoke before we left, so that made me not want to go shopping with her. She texted me this Christmas Eve asking if we were still going and I said probably not since I wasn't feeling well, headache and the runs. Never heard back from her to this day. Last year wasn't fun because she rushed me telling me we had to leave because she's done at this store and kept telling me to stop buying so much because we wouldn't have enough room. Yea, while her cart was full and I was carrying a shopping basket.

1202," I got my first ever job in a new city, new country, new culture, new everything. Got my first ever review where my manager made a huge list of negative comments about me and ended up using all of the space on the form to refute","First time poster here! This actually happened this past Friday and I've been sat wallowing in my own misery ever since, figured I'd get it off my chest!

So I started a new job a couple of months ago, moved to a completely new city, don't know the area, don't know anybody. So at the moment work encompasses my entire life, which is fine because I actually love my job! Apparently though my manager has concerns that I'm not fitting in and that I'm not happy which couldn't be further from the truth, I'm just not a naturally enthusiastic person. 

So my two month review comes around and she discusses these concerns with me, some of which we've talked about before and some of which I disagree with. She had typed up two pages of comments which left me feeling like I had to defend myself. She asked me to write down any comments I had in a little box at the end............long story short I end up using the box and another two pages stapled onto the form to completely refute all of the comments she made, all in the hopes that we would have another chance to talk them over.

Well, that talk never came. About an hour after I'm called into HR and was told that I had been suspended pending a review in the middle of the week. The result of which could be me losing a job I love, being stuck with rent I can't afford and bills I cannot pay. If I keep my job, I may have also completed fucked up the relationship with my manager who I actually think is really nice. 

Looks like Santa has a big present in his sleigh for me this year......Unemployment.

1203," I want to visit my ex, but I don't know if it will set me back in my recovery. Is it a bad idea to visit her in December? Is there a better way to get over her (or anyone else for that matter).","We had a perfect 4 year relationship. We never fought, we only had good times together. When we graduated university she went back to her home across the country. She is financially dependant on her family, and I understand that she couldn't move across the country just for our relationship. We had to break up because it would have been long distance forever. That was 2 months ago and we talk around once every 2 weeks. It's really hard to get over her since we didn't have any fights or difficulties with eachother. I want us to be together, but I know it's impossible. I have to get over her. Last time we talked we played with the idea of me visiting her for 4 days in December. She wants me to come. Her family is fine with it and we would be able to sleep together. I feel like it might be a 4 day time machine, where we pretend like we are still together. This sounds delightful to me right now, but I'm wondering if it will have devastating implications for my well being and recovery. Would going to see her set me back to square one in my recovery? Is this playing with fire? Could it actually be positive? Thanks /r/breakups!

1204," I want my fiancee to go out with me to social gatherings and parties, but she is reluctant to do so. Should I let it be or try and get her to come out and enjoy herself more?","So I needed to make an account to ask this since I do not know where else to go. 
Little bit of background, been with my so for 2 years, 7 months engaged and living together, 9 months prior to that we were long distance. She does not have very many friends in this area were we are now and for the 9 months she was long distance she had little to no friends there as well.

 I have been trying to get her to go out for the random drink at the bar or dinner and she is always reluctant to come or just outright denying it. The same goes for any party or social gathering that may be going on. The latest is a new years eve party which is dinner and drinks with a few friends, which is exactly what she has told me she wants in a social gathering (read not a bunch of bro's getting hammered on a sat. night).

I have talked to her about my concerns with this and she just says that she does not have need for social interaction that I do. She also says that it is fine that I go to these things without her. However, I feel like I have to make excuses for her as to why she is not out with me. This really bums me out. Occasionally when I do go out without her she will give me the guilt trip of saying ""oh you're leaving me alone tonight"" kind of thing. I normally just ignore that and invite her again then leave.

When she does come out with me she gets along great with everyone and genuinely seems to have a good time. At this point I am her main interaction other than her work,who are all older than her, and multiple calls to her mother though the day. 

Sorry if this is a bit scattered, I am just trying to get everything down. 

So should I just let it go that she doesnt want to go out? or Should I try and coax her to come out and try enjoying herself more?

1205," I applied for a job 6 weeks ago, had phone interviews, went in for an interview, had a 5 day wait time for a decision, now 3 weeks later and still no word. What do?","Hi Everyone!

First and foremost, thank you all for great content that helps the wonderful people of this sub educate themselves and eventually land jobs. I am similar to most of you (100+ applications, limited callbacks, still striving!) and have a question. 

I applied for a company about six weeks ago and got an email stating they wanted a phone interview (recruiter screening). After I completed the initial interview, I was passed on to the hiring manager for another phone interview. I was then asked to come in for a interview. After the interview, I asked the HR/Recruiter when I should expect to hear back about the position and was told it would be roughly 5 days. 

It has now been a little over three weeks since the interview and still nothing. I have emailed the recruiter twice since then, and each time he says ""We still have not made a decision. I will know more in a week."" The week then goes by and I hear nothing. 

Now, I know for a fact they were still (and probably still are) interviewing more candidates. Are they just stringing me along because they don't want to close the door on a potential candidate? Should I just take this as they are trying to get someone with better qualifications than me? 

I was supposed to get a response on Friday of last week and never got one. I'm not sure if I should keep going with this and do ANOTHER follow up, or if I should just take it as I was not the best fit and send a thank you letter. 

Any help would be great as to what my next move should be. Thanks a lot in advance.

1206," I want to date a girl who is mature and has a little more ""traditional"" values (Christian morals basically, but I am not religious so that isn't a huge deal to me), but I find that really hard to find in my age group","I'll try to keep this clear, concise, and complete. I'm a college kid who got out of a really serious relationship a few months back, the girl who I was going to get married to cheated on me and then left. That is basically unimportant, but gives you some insight into my background.

I'm not a guy who really likes going to the bar and hooking up, those aren't usually my type of women and it doesn't make me feel good to ""score"" a babe for the night. I'd like to date a girl who is mature and has a little more ""traditional"" values (Christian morals basically, but I am not religious so that isn't a huge deal to me), but I find that really hard to find in my age group. When I try to talk to older women who I feel may be ready for something a little more serious, they would rather talk to guys who are older than me. 

I know I'm not the only person who has been in this situation. Has anybody felt this way? Have a success story? Where are all the ""keepers"" of the world? Where is a good place to pick up women, other than the bar? I don't expect an answer to these questions, I'm just struggling to find someone who I think is on the same level as me in most aspects, and that sucks.

I know that the first and foremost piece of advice would be just ""not to worry about it"" since I am so young, or stick and out and wait until I get older. Well, I am very comfortable with myself, but I'm ready to move on and at least look for something new. Any help?

We had a class together, and although we barely talked, I couldn't get him out of my head.

1210," Husbands friend rolled joint in front of our baby and I want to tell him to stop doing it, but husband thinks we should just remove baby from the situation if/when it ever happens again.","Wall of text sorry.

Our main social circle revolves around my husbands mates, they spent their 20's together stoned. Then they all grew up; there is never pot around the group anymore except when one friend who now lives in a remote town comes to visit (about 4 times a year), let's call him Bob. 

On Friday Bob was in town with his wife and kids (3&6). The boys went to the pub for lunch and carried in to a mutual friends place afterwards. 'The girls' spent the afternoon together with the kids at another friends place. Come about 6pm kids are worn out so we go over to collect husbands then go home. When I get there I go in with baby and say hello to everyone; Bob's kids sit near by coloring (within view of the group, but not paging us any attention). I'm holding baby talking to the group and right there he pulls out a baggie and starts rolling a joint. I shoot him evils but don't say anything, I'm expecting him to just roll it then head outside, our baby is too young to know what's going on and I just don't know what to say. But then he pulls out a lighter and goes to light up, I quickly start to walk away the host scolds him and sends him out in the yard before he lights it. We leave shortly after.

Knowing Bob we're likely to have similar situations arise again throughout our babies childhood. There is no way I'll ever let her be exposed to smoke, that's a given. My main issue is that I don't even want her to see the 'smoking paraphanalia' or see him rolling; my concern is that she will grow up thinking that drug use is normal and something that some adults just do. Bob obviously doesn't think it's a problem as his own kids were right there when it happened.  I really wanted to say something to Bob about it, but husband is very non-confrontational and thinks we should just quietly remove baby from the situation if/when it ever happens again.

Just for the record, I have never been a pot smoker but I don't have an issue with friends doing it; just not around my kids.

He of course doesn't understand my standpoint AT ALL and thinks that i am unreasonable. To him it makes no difference if he watches two girls or one. He even laughed at me sayin: shall i pause a porn as soon as she touches herself?

1212, I met a guy and we have been hooking up for a month and I'm not sure if we are exclusive and I don't know how to talk to him about it. What should I say to him and how should I handle the situation in,"A month ago I met a guy and we immediately hit it off. We do have a lot of shared interests, but we ended up hooking up the first week and the sexual chemistry is like nothing I've ever felt before. Now every time we hang out we have sex and I was ok with a purely sexual relationship at first, but some of his actions have got me second guessing myself. 

He insists I stay the night, he likes to cuddle the entire time we sleep and for hours after we wake up, he always kisses me goodbye and randomly when we hang out (sometimes just on my head or hand), he always responds to my texts promptly and he sends me snap chats throughout the day while we are at work to wish me a good day. Hanging out is usually watching movies and playing video games with or without his friends. At the same time he rarely initiates texting, his texts are mostly one word, and we haven't been on a ""real"" date. 

I was content with letting this ride out in whatever direction it may since I was having fun, but when I left this morning I found a piece of a condom wrapper on a table in his room that wasn't the kind we have ever used. We haven't really had a talk about being exclusive and we've only been seeing each other for a month so I'm not upset with the idea that he is having sex with other people, but it really got me thinking about where the relationship is going. 

I'm not sure if it's too soon to have the talk, but I feel like we should since we are sleeping together. All of the (very few) other relationships I have been in were much more straightforward so I have never been in a situation like this. I really do like him a lot, I need some advice.

Today, he receives a text from a number not saved to his contacts while I'm next to him. He says it's a wrong number and hastily deletes it. A bit later, the same number calls him; he doesn't pick up. I memorize the number. I ask why he's not responding to it and he gets angry.

I wait til he's asleep and send a simple ""hey"" from his phone to the number I committed to memory. Long story short: I figure out that it's his ex-wife and she tells him (me) that she's started cutting again. She states she needs help. I stopped texting and deleted the exchange, panicked and feeling tremendously guilty. 

Have been laying here mulling it over in my head. As a former cutter, I can't not do anything. She and I have never communicated, but I think I'm going to write back to her from my own number and refer her to some resources.

1215," I want to move into a new apartment with a friend of mine, but my current roommates are not happy about it. Would splitting the rent and utilities be a good idea, or is there a better way to handle the situation?","Hi Redditors!

I've been living with my roommates now for 6 months and it's been great. We went to high school together and being roommates was something we talked about for a long time. 

I have a stable job, but it's not the same job I had when I first moved in, so rent has become slightly difficult to pay. Because of that, my roommates had to cover partly for me last month, and I still feel horrible about it.

Recently another friend of mine that I've grown closer to offered to let me move into her apartment for half of what I'm paying now.

I brought this up to one of my roommates and he wasn't too thrilled. He said the lease was just renewed. I thought if I left, I can make room for one who could pay rent and not leave them to cover a balance. 

One of my roommates has his girlfriend over practically living with us on a daily basis and I asked about her chipping in for rent. They replied that her and her boyfriend would just split his current share because the rent amount is designated by room space. If all of us (5) split the rent and utilities right down evenly, it would drop each of our expenses by $100.00. 

But it's not all about the money. I have to walk 3 miles to the closest bus stop and summer is coming (reverse stark). I would then only have to catch One bus instead of three to get to work.

1221," Dad let guy take off with his old car, guy took off with Dad's new car, Dad got a couple of red light tickets for the new car, Dad can't prove it's not his new car, Dad is stupid.","Disclaimer: I know my dad is really stupid. Please don't bash his stupidity because I've probably done enough of that. 

My dad bought a car off Craigslist last October and was going to just trash his old truck. However, the guy that was going to sell us his car liked my dad's car so we basically did a trade and he took off a couple hundred off his asking price for my dad's car. For some stupid unknown reason, there was no legal signature or receipt of anything and my dad let him take off with his old truck with his license plate still attached. (why? I do NOT know.) And my dad either threw away or doesn't remember the guy's name or his phone number. 

Fast forward to February, my dad gets a red light citation from end of January in the mail and it's my dad's old truck with his license plate still on. My dad can't prove with a bill of sale that it's not his car anymore. He did take it off his insurance, but they say they can't accept just that unless my dad has the other guy's name and address. He wrote to the DPS telling them to remove his name from the license right after this, but since the red light happened before he did this, he has to pay. He didn't think he had to do that since the guy apparently told him he was just going to use the car for parts. (Apparently not.)

On top of all of this, I was not here for any of this (the trading/sale of the cars, this whole mess), and I am only learning of this through my mom. She said another red light notice came 4 days later for a different violation, and since it's also before the day the DPS removed his name form the license they say he'd have to pay for that too. It doesn't help that my dad is really fobby and doesn't understand America/english very well. I have no idea what other evidence he might possibly provide to show that the car was not in his possession at the time of these violations.

Our families have always gotten along well, but in the last year or so they hit a rough patch.  Both of our sets of parents do fairly well for themselves, but neither are filthy rich.  Her extended family, however, is extremely well-off, and have always helped out my wife, her sister, and their parents by paying for schooling, cars, and many other expenses.  My family did not have this luxury.

I am currently a full-time law student, and my parents were generous enough to pay for my tuition (~$25k a year after scholarship).  Now, we are buying a house and her parents are helping us significantly.  My parents also support my adult aunt and, until recently, also supported my grandmother.  They've said (without us asking) that they wish they could help us with the house, but they really can't right now.

My wife has been frustrated with me lately because she thinks it's wrong of my parents not to help when her family has done so much for us.  If I try to explain how much my parents give us by paying for my education so I can provide for us down the road, she says that their help is only benefitting me.  I also know that she's spoken with her family about the issue and they feel the same way.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I'm at the end of my rope!  I don't want problems between our families, but I can't help but feel that they're being unreasonable.  How can I reconcile this mess?

So I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend, call her Mary, for about 2 and a half years. I've been very good friends with somebody else, call her Lisa, for about 3 and a half years.

Last fall I went camping with Lisa. I'm not sure why I thought this would ever be okay but I felt her up in my tent (i.e. second base), during which she was very timidly affectionate (i.e. stroking my arm, light foreplay). At some point we stopped and went to bed. The next day the same thing happened, except that after a while she told me to stop, after which I immediately stopped and left the tent. 

She seemed friendly for the rest of the day, even if things were a bit weird. I told her that I felt bad and wanted to confess to my girlfriend, which she told me not to do. (FYI she has a boyfriend.) The next day I got a text saying she told her boyfriend, so I then told my girlfriend the next morning. She was hurt but we made up and since then we've been closer, if anything. I apologized profusely but she insisted it was okay and that she's rather just move on.

Anyway, Lisa seemed fairly friendly to me throughout this whole ordeal- we even met up once or twice in the next few weeks, during which she seemed lightly affectionate. (This weirded me out a bit and I tried to be as platonic as possible while still being friendly.)

Since then she has basically said she wants space and has been a bit cold, but not completely silent towards me. 

I really feel terrible about the whole thing- I betrayed the trust of my SO, destroyed two important friendships (Lisa's and her BF's), and I may have physically violated a close friend of mine. If possible, I want to rekindle the friendships, but I'd also like some perspective on the whole situation.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it. I feel like if I was the one to tell him it would obviously be detrimental to a relationship that's half a decade old, but unfortunately, also to the guy's relationship with all of his friends that chose to keep him in the dark this whole time.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

1229," Boyfriend spends all of his time online with friends, and when he does spend time with me, he gets angry when I try to talk to him about it. Is there a way to get him to spend more time with me, or is there","Hi Reddit,

I'm a 20F who's been dating a 21M for over a year.

My boyfriend and I are currently in a quasi-long-distance relationship. We live relatively near each other, but my parents are unsupportive of the relationship (for various reasons)… So the time we can spend together is extremely limited. In fact, the majority of the time we ""spend together"" is online, like most LDR couples.

Let me start off by saying that I'm extremely supportive of my boyfriend spending time with his friends. I've learned over the years that time apart is necessary for a happy, healthy relationship. When he tells me he's going out and getting offline, I'm all smiles, and I send him off with a big ""Hope you have fun tonight!"" I'm all for independence, I really am. I'm not one of those girlfriends who expects their boyfriend to drop everything they're doing to come talk to me.

But the thing is, he goes out every single night…without fail. He's gone from around dinner time to 3-4AM. He sleeps all day, wakes up at around 4-5PM, we talk or hang out (if possible) for around an hour, and then he leaves again to go out with friends. 

Every time I try talking about it, he gets extremely riled up. So I just ended up giving up on discussing the issue. But yeah, the other day, when I had a horrible, horrible day and wanted to talk to him for a while, I just acted a little sad that he was leaving, and even then he started getting angry. 

I presume that this is an issue that at least some LDR couples go through. Is this something that I simply have to get over? Am I acting selfish / spoiled for wanting him to stay in once in a while?

This was the first time I've seen her in about eight months (we live on opposite ends of the state). Now this is a girl that I never got over and am still completely in love with. We dated for about five months and then I broke up with her because I was scared of falling in love and was to selfish to admit just how much I cared about her. 
Time passed and I realized just how fucking much she means to me. I tried to forget about her by sleeping around, dating other girls,and just doing everything in my power to push her out of my mind. I saw her this past weekend because she came down for a mutual friends wedding (which we went to together) and realized that I am completely lost without her and can't imagine her not being in my life. 
She has a boyfriend at the moment, and if that wasn't hard enough, he doesn't treat her with respect or the love she deserves (and I know that I could treat her so much better.) Anyway, we had a long talk about it this weekend, and apparently she still loves me just as much as I love her, but we both suck at long distance relationships and she wants to see if things eventually work out between herself and this guy; but she admitted that if they don't, she isn't gonna try dating anyone else and will just wait till we can be together. 
She left this morning and I have been a complete wreck ever since. I just miss her so damn much and am so scared of losing her. I feel so lost and don't know what to do anymore. How do I get through this?

Although, everything in our relationship is good, we havent had arguments or fight i'm kind of contemplating at the thought of breaking up.

I'm so confused with the whole situation, i've felt this way for weeks and i have no idea why. I still enjoy her company but at the same time I feel like i can manage without her.

We went in chronological order where I got the names and stories attached to these conquests. I was fine for the first few but I was pretty upset by the end of this conversation where his final count was FORTY. 

I know it was all in his past while I'm the one in his present and that he hasn't changed being who he is from before I knew that info to after but to think that there were 40 other women before me deeply unsettles me and, to be honest, kind of makes me feel sick/queasy. It makes me think that he disrespects sex. In my mind it shouldn't be something you should engage in because you *can* (as from most of his stories it appears to have been for him; a challenge to see if he could). 

I love him very much and actually see myself spending the rest of my life with this man. I'm not worried he's going to cheat or anything bad like that and I know he can't erase his past (if he even wants to) but I can't get this out of my head and had I learned this before I fell in love with him it probably would have been a deal breaker. However, he is an amazing man and I love him very much.

Not sure how it all started, but basically I'm instantly attracted to any woman wearing pantyhose, stockings, leggings, etc. I find them so incredibly sexy, I could literally sit down, have a girl put her legs on my lap and just rub them for hours. It's such a turn on it's ridiculous. I always prefer to have sex while she's wearing stockings or something like that. 

Having such a huge fetish for them, one of my ex girlfriends from years ago told me to try on a pair while we had sex, and I loved it. We were both wearing them, and the feeling the nylon gives when you trace your hands across sensitive areas is amazing. 

Having experienced that, and having such a big fetish for them, I eventually started wearing them to bed every now and then, and when I masturbate. Lightly tracing circles around sensitive areas when wearing them gives an amazing sensation, and I find they just feel awesome in general to wear.

1242," Supervisor is a closet homosexual who has anxiety issues and takes off work frequently to see medical professionals.  He's collecting full benefits and is 5 years from full retirement benefits and is deciding to ""hang in there"" but I think he's malingering","An old supervisor of mine has anxiety/depression and is also a closet homosexual. Needless to say he goes to see medical professionsals a lot.  I'm not going to say he's malingering on purpose but he only works 2 days a week because he isn't required to work on days he has therapy.  In my opinion he is unfit for duty and should go work somewhere he can relax a bit more and be himself.  We've talked about it and he thinks it would eliminate the source of a lot of his stresses.  However collecting a decent paycheck with full benefits and paid vacation and being 5 years from full retirement benefits he's deciding to ""hang in there""

I can't say I blame him really because  Im sure he does suffer from some OCD/anxiety and it would be really hard to be gay in our work culture but having worked for him and being friends I know there is a certain amount of embellishment.  But the fact that before his latest episode that caused him to go to therapy three times a week he would often take weeks off at a time due to issues too sensitive to question.  Admittedly I'm a little jealous and wish I could work the system in such a way.  Still I am hesitant to fully point the finger on the slight chance that it really is as bad as his medical history claims but I can't help but be skeptical.

Can I get a refund or compensation for the time and money spent on repairs, or is that entirely out of","Unfortunately I'm a Georgia resident and our lawmakers decided lemon law statues shouldn't apply to motorcycle consumers. In July '13 I purchased a new Triumph Daytona 675 ABS model and have continually been bent over by constant issues.

It was first in the shop within a month of purchase for an oil leak. Shortly after (hours/days I forget, but theres paperwork proving) it had to be taken back in because dipshit forgot a crush washer and it was still leaking.

Cool, my bike is fixed! Just kidding, coolant leak. This happens about 1-2 months after the initial oil problem. It spends roughly several weeks in the shop over the course of two attempts, and the problem doesn't get fixed properly by them. I give it a crack myself, lo and behold the hose clamp just needed tightened. FUCK YOU.

Well here comes another issue. The bitch just decided to turn off mid ride and throw a check engine light & oil light. There's no need to add any oil, doing so would just overfill it from where it's at. The bike actually doesn't use much oil at all (aside from when it fucking leaked months prior).

This is going to be it's like uh.. 5th visit or so to the dealer for issues in 8 months. It's already spent somewhere near 2 months in the shop, and going off past experiences it's probably going to spend another 2-3 now, if not longer because riding season is up and going in Georgia.

My issue is, again, that I am not protected by any state lemon laws. How far does the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act go? Will a lawyer be able to push for a full refund or compensation with a new machine, or is that entirely off the table due to fucktarded state laws? It's complete bullshit that a bike has to spend 3 months in the shop out of what will be 9 months of ownership by the time that I get it back from the shop.

1245, I forgot my fiance's birthday and his only birthday wish is to get a pair of shoes that he has been wanting since he was a little boy. I have until tomorrow to get them to him. I have no idea what to do.,"Well, rather than today, I've had a whole month long period of fucking up. 

My fiance's birthday is tomorrow. Tomorrow is also the day that Marty McFly arrives in ""the future"". Since he was a little boy, his dream has been to get a pair of Nike Air Mags for his birthday on 10/21/2015 and watch Back to the Future 2 while wearing them and reveling in his day. He's been telling me about this plan, literally, since we met four years ago. LITERALLY.

In September, he asked me to get him a pair for his birthday. Any version would do and he even recommended that I save money and just get a pair from a costume site ($99). 

I looked them up, bookmarked them and then promptly forgot. Forgot about the shoes, forgot about his birthday mirroring the date that McFly arrives in the future, forgot that this was his only request for his birthday in 2015. 

The month of October, he's psyched himself up. He thinks that I remembered and purchased the shoes. He thinks that I'm not a total jackass who has forgotten her fiance's ONE WISH. He tells his friends about what I'm doing, unbeknownst to me, they high five and congratulate him on how badass this will be. 

That puts us here, today, October fucking 20, 2015. As we leave from work together, on the West Coast, around 5pm, he turns to me as we wait at a light. ""I normally am really good at waiting,"" he says, ""but I can't wait anymore. I have to ask. Did you order them and have them delivered to the office? I haven't seen any packages arrive at home for you this month.""

It is at this point that my stomach falls out of my butt and complete horror washes over me. I have forgotten his one request. As I think about it and apologize and scramble to find a way to get him these damn shoes before the end of the day tomorrow, I come to the sad realization that I cannot ever make this up. 

There is one date ever that I could have pulled this event off.

I have been dating my current gf from my freshman year of HS, and moving into my senior year I feel like this relationship is keeping me from growing as a person in a way. I don't have any experience with other girls, and have always been restricted when it comes to social interaction with girls because of my GF. 

I feel like as a 17 y/o male, I should be free to do what I want, and not feel like I am in a constricted relationship. I believe it is having negative effects on me, and I think later on in life I will regret not being freer during my best years/early adulthood.

Despite this, I am happy with my girlfriend, I just don't know if I could be happier. Or how happy I should/could be. Idealistically I want an open relationship, but my gf isn't down for that, as expected. 

I talked to her about this yesterday, and she was pretty mad about what I was saying, understandably. I just don't know what to do, break up with her and live freer, or stick it through because I have something most people would love to have. I constantly feel urges to cheat, and have cheated, and who knows about the future. But I don't want to leave her.

I hope that makes sense. I basically just need to know if how I feel is justified, or if it's hormones or something. I'm maturing and feeling this way is really fucking with me.

Whenever we're together everything is perfect; we are very much in love and everything we do together is fun. However, when we're apart or stop communicating for a day or two I start becoming more and more insecure. I have a history of cheating exes, and I admit that I am a misogynist, but I really believe that this girl is the one. She is perfectly fine with not talking to me at all for days on end, and this sort of bothers me. 
I am a hopeless romantic and she is fairly realistic. I understand that how she spends her time is her business, but a text or something to let me know she's thinking of me would mean so much to me, as little as that is. I am definitely a believer that communication is very important in a relationship; is asking for a text/short phone call every day a bit much?
This is her first relationship, and I have done everything I can to let her know that she is the world to me. She is extremely happy with me as a boyfriend besides the fact that I can be a little overbearing at times, and I plan on working on it. I just want a little compromise to make things a little easier to get into.
I am very willing to make this work because she does mean the world to me. Throughout the course of this relationship I have changed and am slowly but surely learning my way around fully trusting her now. Coming from a long distance relationship (I was in Canada, she was in Taiwan), we would Skype/video call daily and it just seems like now, without the daily reminder that I am important to her, I start doubting that I am.
I dislike how I make her feel like I am smothering her, does anyone have advice for this situation?

We've had our ups and downs, but always made up and been happy together.

However, right before summer, we broke up for a couple months but continued to talk. We hung out and eventually started going on dates again, which led to us getting back together recently. Things have been great since then. When we got back together she told me that a guy that I had often said likes her, but she didn't believe me, told her he likes her and sent her dick pics while we were broken up. She assured me that she put him in his place and told him she wasn't attracted to him and said she hadn't talked to him since. This was all about a month ago.

A few days ago, she was using snapchat and I saw that she had sent him a message. I asked her about it and she just said it was a picture of rain because he sent one to her. I asked her why she replied, to which she got very defensive so i let it go for then. Later, I brought it back up and she then mentioned she had talked to him earlier at school. I told her I don't want her talking to him because it shows him what he did earlier (dick pics) was ok. At this point she got very mad and said I was being immature, I wasn't respecting her rights and that she could talk to whoever she wanted. I responded by telling her that she was being inconsiderate.

I haven't talked to her very much since then (Saturday). And at this point I'm not sure what to do. Should I end it, get over it or try to talk to her about it?

She did and was surprised I asked her to.

Next, I wanted to see the same conversation for a stupid reason. We were discussing who texted whom first and I asked to see the same text from the same time in the first reason. I selfishly thought that since it was already in the open it was fair game for me to invade that space again. In the moment I didn't think about this but she felt it was the same way.

And now recently I asked her a question about a friend she has. I asked her about him and if they had a romantic past. She seemed very disappointed and said she had already told me no (but I had forgotten). She said, ""What? do you think I have a secret boyfriend or something?"" I asked her right when I dropped her off and she was late to be home, and said we'd talk about it the next day.

It's been 2 days and we have not talked about it but have been hanging out consecutively since I last asked her. But everything has been normal and we're very loving towards each other. We've built our relationship strong and right from the start, we are very fond of one another. She is the type of girl that won't give her attention to anyone and I'm lucky and grateful to have it.

Now how do I make her feel like I trust her. I know she feels, even slightly, like I don't trust her and am a ticking time-bomb of jealousy. Do we just move on like nothing ever happened?

One is going to be a beer like Sam Adams (a Vienna lager) and a beer called Spotted Cow (cream ale), which is present in every single Wisconsin liquor store, grocery store, and gas station. Both of these styles are easy-drinking, light, and similar enough in taste to a Budweiser, Miller High life, or PBR well-received by any kind of beer drinker. The third beer I want to be a style that is a change of pace but not too ""pretentious"" or ""bold"".

But me, being the over-thinker i am, still thinks he isn't over the girl he's had a crush on for a while now.

One job is Business Development but is basically a travelling sales job (selling lab analyzers) and the other is a Graduate program with four placements over two years.

The sales job is higher paid, with better perks (company car etc), I can work from home so I won't be paying high rent and is a permanent contract. Sales is not something that I had imagined doing in college (Majored in Biochemistry) but I think I could be good at it, however, I have heard that it is a lonely job? The company is undergoing a lot of expansion so there should be good development potential but there is a high turnover of staff and from what I have read there seems to be low morale (may not affect me if I am working from home?)

The graduate program would give me experience in a number of areas (no details yet), it has a fantastic reputation and in general people who come through it become managers within the organisation. It would be more lab based (manufacturing/QC) so probably more related to my degree but I'm not sure if I am suited to the highly regulated environment. The company is an established market leader with an excellent global reputation and treats its employees very well.

1262," Roommate is always in the room, leaving me with no alone time with my boyfriend.  Is there a way to ask for a little alone time without coming across as creepy or immoral?
TL;DR: Roommate is always in","Okay, so I don't have a lot of friends.  It's always been difficult for me to make connections with new people, and other than my boyfriend I have zero close friends.  This leads to me receiving a random roommate every year.  

I was abroad last semester, and returned to my home campus and was matched with my current roommate, we'll call her Rosie.  Rosie is very sweet, fun, and doesn't have a lot of friends either.  She's a freshman and I'm a junior, but we've gotten to be quite close in the last month.  I'm establishing all this to say that she's not just a random roommate, but someone I consider a friend.  

Rosie is religious (recently converted to Catholicism) and has never dated.  She knows and likes my boyfriend, Kyle, but they've only interacted a couple times.  Rosie is always in the room, usually studying.  She doesn't go to the dining hall and she isn't in any clubs or activities, so if she's not in class she's right here in the room.

My boyfriend (we've been together 3 years) and I arranged our intimate time around her schedule.  The only time she's in class and we aren't is early Friday morning for one hour, so that's when he comes over and we cuddle/have sex.  This is the only alone time we get, so I value it greatly.  

Rosie told me that on Fridays, her class is no longer mandatory so she doesn't think she'll go at that time anymore.  This leaves me with zero time alone with my boyfriend, which is a dismal prospect.  Rosie thinks Kyle and I are abstinent, and seeing as this is my first positive roommate experience ever, I don't want this to spoil her impression of me.

-He messages other women and numerous points in our relationship, even after we agreed to be monogamous (this is the big one, of course)

1264," I rented a house, paid the full amount of the security deposit, found out that the owner is a scammer who doesn't give a damn about the money she took from us, and is trying to screw other people with the same house. What","Hey reddit,
my gf and I are having an hard time after we rented a vacation home for 4 days in Pocono last week (Memorial day).
We paid (by check) the full amount including 150$ of security deposit.

The house was supposed to have a working hot tub. When we got there we noticed that the tub was making a loud noise and reported an error (FL1) on the screen. 
Also, there were stains on the carpets pretty much every 3-4 ft. Those stains were clearly old.

So the first day we contacted the owner by email (and phone, but she ignored the calls) letting her know that the hot tub wasn't working. In the contract is written that they would provide maintenance for the hot tub, and they didn't.
We clearly told them that we choose this house (more expensive) just because we wanted an hot tub (fun fun fun) so we requested also at least 100$ back from the total rental price.

We tried for a week to contact the owners (4 different phone numbers and by email) but they of course ignored us. Today she sent us images (dated 2 DAYS after we checked out of the property) from the cleaning crew showing that the hot tub cover was moved (never touched the thing since it wasn't even working, and there were storms the nights after we left - so it could have been moved by wind/heavy rain) and showing stains that were already there when we got in. Also, those stains pictured are from a bedroom on the second floor which we didn't even use, and opened only the first day to check it out, leaving it closed for the remaining of the trip.

So, I checked online for her name and I found other people complaining about the SAME house and SAME owner, doing the same thing to them: scamming the security deposit.

I don't care about the 150$ so much, I just want to see those scumbags burn in the fire of the law. What can I and should I do now?

Should I do it, and if so, how should","At one point years ago, we went to the same school. We had a class together and I learned his name and found him online. I wanted to talk to him back then, or just send a message, but never had the nerve. So, we never actually had a conversation. School ended, I moved away, had multiple relationships and jobs... 

But I never forgot him.

A few times a year I would google him to see what he was doing. I found his blog which went as far back as to when we were in school together, and found out we had a lot more in common that I originally thought. If only I had known then what I know now, I definitely would have tried to talk to him. ""If I ever see him again, I'll march right up and start a conversation like a normal person!"" I've been telling myself. Yeah right, I'd probably lose my nerve again. :( 

I'm going to be in his city for a few days during the holidays to visit friends. There is a tiny chance that he will be at a bar at the same time that I am, but a bigger chance he won't be. I live far away now and don't go back for visits often.

Reddit, should I message him and confess everything? 

I don't want him to feel creeped out, and if he wasn't interested then I would respect that. A flat-out rejection might be just the thing to finally get him out of my head.

Has anyone else ever gone through this? I've read a lot about ""limerance"" and it sounds pretty close to my situation. I don't know what else to do to get over it though.

If anyone is in Edinburgh and is willing to pick up the gift and send it to me in the States, that would be great.","I apologize in advance. I know this probably isn't the right place for this post, so if there's a better place, I would be more than willing to move it.

I just got back from my Ireland/UK trip yesterday, and the morning before I left I picked up a small gift for a friend of mine at a Cafe in Edinburgh. In my stupidity, I left it on the Airlink bus when I arrived at the airport. By the time I realized, I ran outside to find the bus closing its doors and pulling away. I chased that damn bus for as long as I could, but didn't stop.

Normally, a small gift wouldn't matter, but not only was I really looking forward to giving this gift (It's a thank you for the person who gave me advice before traveling to Edinburgh) but it has now become personal, with me and that bus. I almost threw up after chasing that bus and I  have never run that hard in my life. If some form of that gift does not make it to the States I will never let it go.

I called the lost property number before my flight and sent a follow up email. The customer service was great and I spoke with a nice woman who seemed pretty sympathetic. I just got an email back, however, saying that nothing was turned in but they would check again on Monday.  

My question is, if anyone is currently in Edinburgh and who is planning on returning to the States soon would be willing to pick up something for me, and have it shipped once back in the States. I know it's kind of a long shot and way more trouble than it's worth, but it's kind of important to me.

He has been suffering from depression and anxiety for ~12 years and so his general disposition is one of depression. He feels numb about most things. Either something is ""ok"" or ""not ok"", nothing is ever great. He is always stressed about work - he works in a demanding field as a researcher. The smallest of things stress him out. For example, a work email that he has to reply to or a letter from the IRS - things that normal people consider as mere stuff that needs to get done, turns out to be a huge stress issue for him.

He cares for me a lot and is the best boyfriend I have ever had. The only problem is that he doesn't feel for me as a romantic partner. He won't care if I dump him tomorrow and find someone else because he just wants me to be happy. I love him but I don't want to be with someone who doesn't really want me.

* 2010 Mazda hatchback

* 65k miles

* KBB value: ~$10.5k

After 5 years, I still owe $6500 on it in $400/month payments. (My parents had just gone through bankruptcy, so we took an extremely long loan.)

But I may have the opportunity to go work in France for 1-2 years. The car would sit mostly unused, but I wouldn't have a car payment when I return. That sounds like the safer option to me.

My dad disagrees. He thinks I should sell it, pocket that $4000, and then also close the life insurance policy he sold me in high school and pocket the $4000 value that's in that. He sells insurance and sold me that policy when I was in high school. My understanding was that you should never use life insurance as an investment, but he says that's not true.

I can't help but feel this relationship has no future. 2) She is the 'every relationship should be your last' kind of girl and is 110% committed. I'm feeling scared because I'm not where she is. I'm not a very emotional person with below average EQ, but to her once in a relationship you should be all over each other always. 3) Maybe this is just how I am and I am incapable of anymore.

Of course it could also be all three.

I really like her, she really is great, and I want her to be happy. But my lack of effort/commitment hurts her and because she so committed and invested I feel like I'm wasting her time.

I couldn't find a similar post so here goes:

I was recruited for and have been interviewing for a position for about a month. They seemed highly enthusiastic, I made myself extremely available for interviews so that they all happened in relatively rapid succession in mid July and they asked that I come in for a face to face. The job is in the Netherlands (I live in the UK) so I bought a ticket to meet the first week of August. 

The interview went great. I met everyone in the small company, we got along famously... and then they mentioned that one of the guys I had just met had been hired a few weeks before and technically filled the position I had been interviewing for BUT that they had been unable to choose between the two candidacies so they were looking to hire us both.

I don't know what to make of this situation. How did this guy get hired so quickly? Does this mean I will be considered expendable if the company realizes an extra person is unnecessary? Most importantly, should I email the interviewer and vocalize my concerns? If so, how should I phrase it?

It's worth noting that at the start of all this, they emphasized that they needed someone who spoke French (this guy doesn't, but I do) and that they were interested in branching out into social media if I would be interested in taking on the challenge (but in the f2f interview, I was told there was already someone who did that and ""maybe I could help him""). I don't have loads of experience in the working world yet and I tend to just be grateful someone wants to hire me, but now I'm afraid I'm being scammed or led on (or maybe I'm just overthinking it and being excessively paranoid)...

It had been happening for quite sometime and although I had felt bad about it for quite some time I never thought she would find out and that it would hurt this much.

Needless to say she is crushed, her confidence is gone and now she has to go to school and look at these girls (we are from a small town, there's no avoiding it), everyday. She has chosen to stay with me because regardless of what our age might say, we are very serious and, despite my obvious shortcoming in this situation, we are both mature about it. I love her and want to do whatever it takes to earn her trust back, and I realize this will take time. What can I do to start the process, and what are some things I can avoid along the way? 

Any help is appreciated and I thank you all greatly ahead of time.

1282, I'm a quiet person who wants to be more social and happy with people. Is there a way to change my personality and how can I narrow down my search for a partner to share happiness with (or is there a better way to word that).,"Its gonna be pretty long to explain my situation. Sorry.
So i'm a junior in high school and by nature I am very quiet and talk only with really close friends. I'm not afraid of talking for long periods of time but small talk absolutely kills me. I've been labelled as a strong silent type by some people due to my build, personality, and the fact that (according to my peers) my normal face looks like my serious or pissed off face. I dont really get it personally but thats just what i've heard from other perspective
. Anyways, lately i've been hanging out with my classmates more often via my more sociable friend. My classmates afterwards said i'm actually quite funny once they got to know me. Since I had gotten to talk to more people I ended up becoming quite friendly with them. 
Skipping over some details this eventually led to me buying some christmas presents for some people. In return, one girl gave me a Christmas card with a very long winded and thoughtful response on how I was a very caring person, and that i'm appreciated by many folks, etc. (This girl is taken by the way, just quite nice). But the card struck some particular cord and it made me realize that I had been missing out on a lot of happiness with my peers, including a serious relationship. I realized that I wanted someone to share this kind of happiness all the time with. 
To sum it all up I don't know exactly what i'm looking for, all I know is that i'm looking for somebody to be happy with where previously I had been quite distant and isolated. Is there any way I could turn my natural personality into strengths? And is there a certain way to narrow down exaclty what i'm looking for? If you need more info just ask

1283," Husband is trying to get his mom to move here, but she lives 2.5 hours away and only visits once a week. He has not told me about it, and I feel uncomfortable with the whole thing. ","Still kind of in shock over this. 
 I just happened to pick up the ipad and see that my husband has been sending emails to his mother telling her that he is going to try his hardest to get her a job at his company, and that they can move into our house. He hasn't told me anything about this.  She and his Dad live 2.5 hours away right now, which is, IMO- a perfect distance.

We've been going to therapy for other reasons - mainly because he's reneged on our initial after-marriage plans.  When we got married, we were planning on moving halfway between both in-laws, but now he dosen't want to.  My family lives 6 hours away and I rarely see them and only talk to them once a week, but he told the therapist that I'm too close to them.

But now he's secretly trying to get his mom to move down here? Please. It hurts my brain. Also, the cost of living here is really high, so if she DID get the job-- she'd probably be living with us for quite some time, which I am NOT mentally prepared for. And when she did  move out, I don't think I can deal with anymore 'drop in' visits to see my son (who is 2.) They already do it enough and they live 2 hours away now.

Should I confront the guy or tell my girlfriend to stop going to his place?,"Hi, so I've been dating my current girlfriend for close to two months now.  I'm 23 and she is 24.  I've always known she has lots of guy friends, however, there is one guy in particular who is starting to really annoy me.  He is constantly texting her and constantly asking her to hangout with him.  Two weeks ago he tried to pull a move on my girlfriend, which she rejected and later told me about.  Since then I've met this guy and he seems to be intimidated by me (will never look me in the eye, won't come near my gf when I'm around, stopped posting publicly on her facebook wall (which he constantly used to do)).  However, his actions behind my back have not changed.  He still texts her almost every hour and tried to take advantage of my gf last weekend (invited her over to his place and gave her super strong alcohol).

For the record (and I'm not trying to gloat or be mean), I'm very muscular and good looking.  This guy is short, fat, and balding.  I've talked briefly with my gf about him and she said she made it clear to him that she is not attracted to him and doesn't want to do anything sexual with him.  However, he is not taking ""no"" for an answer and is constantly trying to have his way with her behind my back.

I've controlled myself every time I've seen him but I'm starting to lose patience.  Should I confront him?  Should I tell my girlfriend I don't want her to go to his place anymore?  Or should I sit back and trust she will continue to reject his advances?

1286," I got a phone message from my dad saying that he was stabbed with a knife and run over by a car, but turns out it was a wrong number. Dad is fine, but we all thought he was dying.","This actually happened two years ago during my summer holiday.

Not sure if this fits in TIFU, as it really wasn't my fu, but I think it's a good story nonetheless.

I had gotten a new job driving around grocery stores placing and sorting liquors and various drinks on the shelves. One day, I had just finished up in the first store when I got a phone message from my dad. To my surprise, the message basically said that he had been run over by a car and stabbed with a knife, and that he was now in a hospital.

At this point, I think that a psychopath has decided to kill my dad for some reason, and that he's either dying or gravely injured. I immediately call my mom, to hear if she knows anything. She hasn't gotten this message herself, and starts freaking out. She in turn calls my brother, who at the moment was working selling newspapers over the phone. He gets quite hysterical after what I heard, and basically stands up and panics. All his coworkers try to calm him down, but he is obviously super stressed because our dad has apparently been in a random freak assault incident. So now all of us think that my dad is dying, and I'm in tears.

But then my mom manages to get in touch with my dad. As it turns out, he is completely fine, and is clueless to the ongoing events. We are all relieved, and are left confused and happy.

He insisted that he hadn't written the message, and that the phone was in his pocket the entire time. I showed him them the message, as I thought it was curious that somehow the words ""stabbed with knife"", ""run over by car"" and ""hospital"" had been typed in the same message, but I got no answer.

I still to this day have no idea why I got that message. I don't believe it was a joke, because that would be a pretty fucked up thing to do. Maybe autocorrect worked its magic.

The message is in Norwegian, but I'm sure there are other Norwegians here who can verify what is written.

1290," Boyfriend and dog were near a fire, but not directly under it, when the cement over expanded and broke, shooting up the fire and causing us to get lucky and escape with only minor injuries to everyone. We feel stupid and are very lucky.","My boyfriend and my dog and I were having a bonfire in the backyard. There's a nice cemented area with a firepit in the middle of it and benches around it. Now, this fire pit has gotten a ton of use, and it's gotten to the point where the bottom of it has melted through. We decided for this bonfire, we'd just move the fire pit out of the way and have the fire on the cement with metal from the fire pit surrounding the perimeter. 

Well we get about two hours into our bonfire, and my boyfriend is standing about a foot away from the fire with his back turned towards it, and I got up to refill our dog's water bowl. As I'm walking away I hear a full explosion. I turn and I see the entire cemented area and benches surrounded by fire and embers. I then see my boyfriend run out of the fire with embers all over the back of his shirt, and I see my dog running away from where he was sitting under the benches. My boyfriend stops drops and rolls in the grass and I'm chasing after my dog trying to make sure he's okay and to keep him away from the area because the entire cemented area and benches has flaming logs all over it. 

For a few moments I was convinced we would be spending the night in the hospital, but we got really really lucky and everyone was fine. We were extremely lucky that my dog was under one of the benches and protected from falling flaming debris, and also that my boyfriend had his back to the fire and escaped with only a ruined shirt and pants. 

So what happened? After a some panicking and some puppy wrangling, we were able to assess the situation. In case you weren't aware, cement expands when overheated. Basically the cement over expanded, shattered, shot up, and caused the entire bonfire to shoot up as well. We feel pretty stupid about what we let happen.

The other night Gary came into my girlfriends room, where she usually sleeps with her sister but she was not there. My girlfriend was alone, and Gary got in her bed and started touching her boobs. My girlfriend told him it was weird and that she had a girlfriend, trying to get him to stop. But he didn't care. He tried to go under her shirt, but she didn't let him. After that he tried touching between her legs, but she said she was on her period to make him stop. At that point he left. She sent me a text telling me this happened shortly after.

She told me, trusted it in me, and told me not to tell ANYONE because she didn't want her already slightly dysfunctional family to fall apart. I woke up my mom and told her however, because I was, and still am, very worried about my girlfriend.

I've tried convincing her to tell her mom but she's very very scared. Gary was in the Air Force, so she's very scared to argue with him or use physical force to stop him if he tries again. The next day after the first incident that she told me of, everyone but her and Gary were going to leave the house. She was going to be alone with Gary. I told my mom this and I picked her up at 9 A.M. To prevent stuff from happening.

I'll start off where everything hit the fan: the beginning of college. 

I was with a girl for years before college, and she was great. Nothing about her was terribly wrong and we had some history as kids, so it was cute. None the less, I went off to college and she stayed back home because she still had some highschool left. We had talked about it, and with me living at college it would be too difficult to come home every weekend. Mainly due to the whole money thing. So, we break it off well until I find out she started dating my best friend literally days after we broke it off. It hurt. A lot.

So second part begins after this. I start dating a girl soon after and become quickly attached. This girl opened my eyes to certain things I hadn't really known, and I love that about new people. We had some differing opinions on smoking pot, and in general just smoking cigarettes due to my ability to just game away my stress. She however felt the need to smoke and blah blah blah. Little side note here, I was her basically true first boyfriend due to VERY strict Greek parents. So, she had a but to learn about talking things out. None the less, she was great up until the second semester began. She became distant, depressed, and a sudden claustrophobia had kicked in from absolutely no where. We tried to talk it out, and I was the most leniant i've ever been to try and keep her around, but to no avail. 

My confused thoughts are this fellow relationshipers:
*I still feel attached to girl 1. her whole family misses me, and ikes me more the better current guy(heh). 
*I still feel attached to girl 2, even though we only dated a short time and she was becoming psychologically more unstable as the days went on.

1297, GF and I have money issues and fight over bills and money. She has anxiety and can't handle confrontation. She has not been to the doctor's to get a diagnosis but says she has anxiety. She has not had a job since she was in,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 19 months now and have started living together back in June. We ran into some money issues and are both in a bit of credit debt. We have started making adjustments so we can pull ourselves out (awesome!).

However, last night I had to come down on her hard because she barely pays the rent each month. In doing so, it turned into me raising my voice at her and fighting. She would constantly tell me to go away and stop talking about the subject matter but I was persistent to make sure she understood that bills need to come first before everything else. Granted she only needs about $400 a month which is almost all of one paycheck but we are roommates and need to split everything, which we aren't.

I understand she is happy to have money finally in her life but I just want her to understand that rent and bills need to come first before personal spending. 

Moving on, she always gets like this when I confront her about anything money related or regarding an issue in our relationship. At least, in person. When I talk to her over texting, she can talk no problem. She tells me she has anxiety and can't do simple tasks like a normal person. She hasn't been to the doctor's to actually be diagnosed but I hope she isn't using it as an excuse for why she doesn't understand these adult things. Maybe she doesn't want to grow up? Maybe she wants me to pay for everything and save her own dough (which I came down on her for again and she just wouldn't look at me and roll her eyes).

It's stressful for me and her because it's now affecting our relationship that was perfect when we moved in together. She said moving forward she will give me the money even though she's got her credit debt (which is nowhere near as high as mine).

I haven't even hinted at it, but I don't know I want to be with her if she continues much longer. 

Maybe I'm wrong but trying something online thousands of people are already doing seems foolish. The internet is more clutter than actual talent and I doubt she'll be recognized for her art/gaming personality just because of how many others are trying.

Would be. But the things she doesn't like (mostly cheese) are expressly forbidden from being eaten around her. She gets annoyed if I even suggest it and 'reminds' me that she hates it.

So is this really inconsiderate or is it just me?

1301," Boyfriend and I adopted a puppy, he screams when we aren't home, neighbors have complained, not sure if we can keep him quiet when we are home, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with his crate.","My boyfriend and I adopted a puppy about 6 months ago - he's now 9 months old. Unfortunately, he literally screams like he's being burned to death when we're not home. He doesn't start for awhile - I've waited outside after closing the door for a few minutes and he's quiet - but when we get home from work, we can hear him whining from parking lot outside, and we live on the **third floor**. 

Normally I wouldn't care, but the neighbors have complained several times. We know to just ignore the noise until he stops, so he doesn't associate his screaming with us getting home. The issue is that he knows he has to be quiet in order to get out of his crate, so he stops as soon as he hears us on the stairs or, if we sneak up, as soon as we unlock the door. He'll even voluntarily go in his crate sometimes to sleep, so I don't think he hates it in there. 

I think he's associated his whining with us *coming home*, though at least not with him getting out of his crate. I'm not sure what to do! Sit outside in the parking lot until he stops, while the neighbors get more bent out of shape?

It took me months to decide. I felt like I would be nothing if I resigned, my outside life was empty. Not to mention the fact that the main gaming network owner needed me, there was no replacement. Eventually I decided that it was time for me to go, and after finding a suitable replacement I left the game behind in capable hands.

I felt empty. What the fuck was I going to do with my life?

The conversation wasn't even about carpool plans, but what we would do over Spring break and she said ""we should totally  carpool"" and I responded with ""maybe, we probably could"" and that was the end of it.

So depending on whether or not she can find someone to meet me near the middle, it adds an extra 40-100 miles to my trip.

Is it shitty of me to not wait a week for her to finish finals given our ""plans?"" 

Would this actually be considered ditching her?

1321," I feel like my girlfriend is using me for sex, but she says she wants to have sex. She doesn't show appreciation for the sex we have, and it's making me question my sexuality and my relationship with her. Is it unethical to leave","I'm having more trouble adjusting to my girlfriends libido than expected. She doesn't have a thyroid anymore, so she has to take meds for that. The one thing that the meds don't fix, is her sex drive- or lack thereof.
When we make love, i feel like it's a one-way dialogue. The confusing thing is, she says she wants to have sex. If we're in/on the bed without sex, she'll say i kinda 'left her hanging' if i don't feel like doing 100% of the work.
We've gotten to the point where my sex drive is starting to dimish (along with my confidence) due to her lack of input in the sexual acts. She does not counter any fysical acts like giving massages or foreplay. Pretty much all she does is follow instructions when given and kiss back at appropriate time. She says that she has trouble giving fysical stuff because of insecurities. She says she enjoys our sex very much, but i can't keep giving her sexual energy if she never shows appreciation or affection. Is it unethical of me to think about leaving her mostly because of our sexlife?

TL;DR: Boyfriend has a membership to cams.com,","Ok, to start, I know the age difference is... disconcerting. I can answer questions about that if you have any. But the reason I'm writing is; this is a new relationship, we're still figuring things out. We have been trying to take things slowly, being careful not to rush into things. He has been more than honest with me from the get-go, any and all questions he gives me quick and honest answers. He gave me the account info for his xfinity account so that I could watch tv. You know how the buttons for tv, and email are right next to each other? I accidentally clicked into his email, I went to close out of it when an email caught my eye. Sent at the beginning of the month from cams.com saying that his premium subscription was about to expire. The emails before and after were unread except this one. I assume he renewed it because he received their monthly email yesterday. 

I had asked him before if he looked at porn and he said yes, but not very often. Porn I am fine with as long as it doesn't interfere with our relationship, heck, I might even watch it with him. But this feels different to me, with his membership he could not only view the cams, but do private shows, chat with the girls one-on-one, etc,. And the emails were sent while we were together. We had sent pictures to each other and I thought it was interesting that he had always been very comfortable asking for certain things, but never gave it much thought; now it all makes sense. And it's left me feeling weird. I plan on talking to him about it. But I'm just not sure how to feel about this whole situation. What do you guys think?

1323," I want to throw out all the bottles and cans my best friend has accumulated over the past 6 months, but don't want to cause a rift in our relationship over something so small and stupid. Should I just throw them out when she's not home","I live with my best friend and she is the messiest person I've ever been around in my life. I didn't know it was this bad before we moved in (8 months ago), but now I know. I still love her despite her messiness, but obviously it's starting to trail into my life, which I dislike.

For the past 6 months she's been collecting beer and liquor bottles and cans in our household. Her boyfriend drinks like a fish and the 2 of them can easily put away 20 cans/bottles in a night, so on top of that happening every week, and parties .etc over 6 months, we have a shit ton of bottles in the house that have started to make their way into our shared living space, and I fucking can not stand it.

I hate this, not only because it looks disgusting and like we're alcoholics (not even a quarter of those bottles/cans are mine), but it looks like we live in a trashy frat house. I'm serious, the bottles and cans are everywhere. She is keeping them because she wants to eventually bring them back to the store to get money back for the cans. I've asked her probably 5 times now to please get rid of them. I've asked nicely and she keeps saying she will, but weeks keep passing and she keeps collecting them.

Now we're at the point where there's bags of cans in our living room, and bottles on the table tops, just making our house look like shit. I want to throw them all out and not care, but I don't want to cause a rift in our friendship over something so stupid and small.

She counted the bottles and cans the other day and she would likely get around $25 back for all the ones that we have in the house right now. Should I just throw them out when she's not home and give her the $25? I know how she is, and she will keep collecting them and keep making our living space look like shit, because it doesn't bother her. Messy is normal to her, so it doesn't affect her at all. This is ridiculous.

She's in school still and a bit strapped for cash so I've even offered to pay. She's keeps saying she will go but keeps procrastinating. I know things are really hectic for her right now trying to find a new place to rent and finals to study for, but I feel like squeezing in a test isn't unreasonable.

I would rather not ask about her sexual past as I tend to get jealous and over think things when I hear about past experiences. So I figured she could just get the test and I could move on.

feb 6-arrive in vegas at 10am, cruise the strip, gamble a small amount of money, maybe see a show. 
7-Drive to flagstaff, see the wupatki monument, and maybe explore flagstaff (not exactly sure what the plan is for the rest of the day)

9-rent a bike(not motorized) and try to find some mountain biking spots
10- Head back west->see boulder city/hoover dam
11-zion national park
12- valley of fire
13, plane home leaves at 930am

We've been doing long distance for the past 6 months (and have done long distance successfully in the past) but about 2 months ago he told me he wasn't happy in his life or at school without me there.

1328, I have a lot of issues with my girlfriend and I don't know if I can keep going with the relationship. But I don't want to lose her because I really do like her a lot. Advice on how to deal with the issues and if,"So recently our friends who have been best friends finally started dating. They are absolutely perfect for each other and it has made me look at my relationship.

90% of my relationship now is sex. I'm not the one initiating. Every time we see each other she has a tendency to start things and i have no idea how to say no. I don't mind it but its to the point where that's most of what we are and I hate that. I always wanted to be in a relationship where we would talk and discuss and laugh with sex occasionally. And there is the second problem, whenever we discuss she seems offended by a lot of what I say. It's as if me having a different point of view than her treason.

And another main issue is with me. I have terrible self esteem. Not to the point where its crippling but it is pretty bad. I get jelous easily. Her best friend is male and that makes me worry as I see these other 2 best friends finally dating and how perfect they are. I worry I'm not that for her. Honestly with all the issues recently I have been thinking about ending the relationship but one thing is holding me back. I'm not attractive or at least I think I'm not and I worry that if I leave her I may never find someone else. I know it sounds dumb and its super easy to say ""There are plenty of fish in the sea"" but it's hard to believe. Advice?

I know all of his close friends and family, but for some reason it bothers me that he never goes to this one hangout whenever I am with him, but he is there often when I am not with him.

At first it was definitely somewhere between a mentor/friend role, but over time it developed into a genuine friendship, especially post high-school.
We've always been extremely compatible, but we were both in long term relationships.

My biggest concern, which I've voiced to her, is that I'm preventing her from enjoying all the fun, formative experiences in college (like having that random drunken hookup, etc).

He went way out of his way to ask me out (in fact, I'm pretty sure what he did breaks some confidentiality clauses), and we've been having a really good time together. We go out on weekends, text everyday, I've been introduced to his cousin, and I know his friends and brother know he's seeing me.

So, after a few days of thinking that he'd been back and not hearing from him, I texted him, he seemed excited to hear from me, and said he wanted to see me the following night (Saturday). So far, so good. But then he calls me Saturday afternoon to say he's too tired and wants to reschedule for Sunday. So, we get together on Sunday night, have a good time, but then I noticed that, even though he's only had his new phone for a couple of days, one of the apps he's already installed is OKC (and he even made a big deal about not having apps like Yelp because they had to be reinstalled) and there's a pair of dirty wine glasses by his sink.

One year ago I moved to a new city for a new job, and because I didn't know anyone here, I had to find a roommate on Craigslist. The best option (she had a place close to my new job) was ""Kate."" I had a female roommate in the last town I lived in, and it was fine, so I didn't think anything of it.

Thinks have been cool. We hang out sometimes, but also both come and go freely. She keeps things neat and is nice. She's also very attractive. Personality-wise, she's not really my type, so it was never an issue.

Until last night. She's been dating a guy, and found out last night he'd been stepping out on her, and she came home pretty devastated. I'm not on today, so I was home drinking and playing video games. She got home, I was pretty drunk, she was really upset, and one thing led to another, we ended up in bed together. It was honestly a lot of fun, but I don't want to date her and I don't want to make things weird. This morning, when she woke up, she said ""Thanks, I needed that"" and kissed me before heading back to her room. She's asleep now, and going to work this afternoon.

First question: is this going to result in weirdness between us? I'm not a player or anything, but I bring girls back to the apartment on occasion. It's never bothered Kate before, but I don't know if that's going to be a problem now.

We ended the relationship on good terms, we mutually agreed to breakup because after the summer we were going to be literally halfway across the world from each other. 

I think this is taking such a toll on me because he's the first guy in my 23 years that I felt myself falling in love with.

Maybe I'm just an immature girl whining about a guy she should have gotten over a long, long time ago. 

It's been 8 months, and I know I should be over him, but I still think about him too much and I look at pictures of us together far more than I'd like to admit. I've unfollowed him on Facebook and don't talk to him anymore because I know I'll just get too attached.

The rational part of my brain is telling me that I'm over romanticizing the relationships, only remembering the good parts, and that we were together for such a short period of time that we didn't even get past the honeymoon phase.

But I was pathetic and needed someone to take care of me so I went over to my then boyfriends house, who wasn't home yet but was getting home from work in a few hours and his roommate was at work too. So no biggie, I would sleep until he got home. But before my nap, I really had to take a dump... So no problem, I went to the washroom, then had a nap and he took care of me for the rest of the day cause I couldn't function as a normal human being. 
Too bad later on that week him and his roommate are talking and arguing (I can't remember the conversation) but I remember her saying ""at least I remember to flush the toilet after I take a shit!"" And he just goes back, ""that wasn't me, it was you!"" And the whole time I'm sitting there like, fuck. That might have been me. After all, I was so out if it I wouldn't have been able to tell you my name, I probably didn't remember to flush the toilet....
And now every time I go to the washroom, I get mad anxiety that I forgot to flush and I have to go back to check half the time, even though there was no proof it actually was me.

I'm so excited to finally be done. I don't have many close friends, but the one friend I do have is very close to me. She's been there for me throughout the last two years of my university experience. We have always supported each other. My family is a little dysfunctional and my siblings weren't able to make it to my graduation. I invited my best friend and she said she wouldn't miss it for the world and she's so excited to see me walk across the stage.

The other day I was on facebook and I saw that this friend was interested in an event in her hometown on the same day as my graduation. I thought maybe she was just ""interested"" in it to see who was going or whatever. But then she tells me that she can't make it to my grad because there's a mandatory meeting in her hometown (4 hour drive away) that she has to be at on the day AFTER my grad so she's going to drive up before that day...

The problem is that my graduation is in the afternoon the day before her meeting, and she would have ample time to drive home after it. I feel like she is really letting me down because I really only had her to invite and she said she would make it. Now I think that she wants to go home for the event I saw that she was interested in on Facebook that occurs on the same day as my graduation.

It was recovered, stripped and destroyed, in the ghetto of the local major city before I even knew it went missing. After filing some reports and making a few calls I determined that I couldn't go get it any time soon, so I went camping for the weekend - as previously planned. 

When I came back home Sunday, I parked my car in it's usual spot at my apartment and went inside to clean up, drop off gear and get ready to leave - I needed to find the parts to fix what I could, on my Jeep; hopefully I could make it drivable. Instead, about twenty minutes into my routine, my neighbor knocked on my door to notify me that some ass hat wrecked into my parked car while I was inside.

I had to take a day off of work yesterday to sort through this mess. I found the Jeep at the impound lot and discovered that the wheels and tires were stolen, the brand-new catalytic converter was cut off, they ripped out the door lock (instead of unzipping or cutting through the soft top), they sheared through the security console, broke the steering column and ripped out the ignition - after cramming a screwdriver into all of the external locks, permanently fucking them all up. Everything inside was stolen, except for my tent rainfly, which wasn't a whole lot but it still adds to the indignation. I had to buy a complete set of wheels and tires just to drive it out of impound, and wasted several hundred more dollars paying for the tow and impound fees. Also, I'd recently removed full coverage since the Jeep was just sitting around as a leisure vehicle and I hadn't driven it much in the last year or so. So, I get to eat the several thousand dollar cost for the theft. Also, most of the cops I had to deal with were really condescending.

TL;DR: I have low iron levels, which has","Hi runnit,

I'm hoping to get some advice on working around low energy levels (from iron deficiency) that are impacting my half-marathon training. I have found articles on how low iron can impact running, and how to get more iron, but I am looking for more personal experience with how to continue training without over exhausting myself.

Normal iron levels are 40-60, and about 5 months ago mine were 12 (23F if you're wondering), and now they're 32. I'm on iron supplements, but when I ran out over a month ago, there was about 3 weeks before I went on them again. Ever since I went off them initially, I've been struggling to get my energy back. My half-marathon is October 11, and this has really put a damper on my training, which was going very well before my energy was shot. After a long run of 11km, I didn't run again until 3 weeks later, and since then I have hardly been able to do 5km 3/week (for about 3 weeks now). 

I've already registered for the race, which will be my third half in three years, and I do still want to do it, even if my time will be much worse than the last two. Does anyone have any suggestions for how I should continue training? Should I focus more on mileage or speed, or alternate? I'm hoping my energy increases over the next month, but currently I'm finding it difficult to pull myself off the couch. I couldn't even make it to 3km today. Any advice is appreciated!!

We live a couple of hours away from our hometown, as we both moved to the city for job opportunities/university. 

At the start of the year my boyfriend's good friend, let's call her Emily, got engaged. We were so happy for her and both attended her engagement party (with a present I picked out). While I am not especially close with Emily I have met her many times, I was at her 21st, have been to her and her fiance's house and we have always gotten along well. 

Yesterday my bf received a call from Emily and she told him that I would not be invited to the wedding, as the guest list was getting too large and expensive, as well as the fact she doesn't see me often. While I understand that weddings are expensive and guest lists must be a huge pain, I also feel incredibly insulted that she has decided to cut me out. 

I know that other plus ones have definitely been invited, and while I know that I don't see Emily very often the reason for that is my bf doesn't see her very often, as we live 2 hours away.  

My bf is very non-confrontational, and while he is also upset that I cannot go I do not believe he would even think to not attend the wedding, even though he will know very few people there. But I feel like after 5 years, our relationship warrants a plus one to a wedding, and to not invite me is insulting and dismissive of our very serious relationship.

     So my ex and I broke up(mutually) after about 5 months of dating. 
We decided to break up because she was going away for the summer to her country and she had told me of a possibility of her getting married/engaged. 
I being an 19 year old male felt I wouldn't be a emotionally mature for something like that and she agreed. It was awkward at first because I still liked her.
     Anyways after she left, we kept up contact for a little while but because I still liked her on a whim I chose to initiate the no-contact rule which the internet says is the only way to get your ex back (and begin self-improvement during no-contact)
 So I sent her an email about two months ago saying that, I no longer could talk to her, I told her I still had strong feelings for her and the only way I could begin moving on is if we no longer spoke. (I'm paraphrasing) 
She responded to the email saying that she was gonna wait to tell me but that she was getting engaged in two weeks (that was about a month and a half ago) her being so young I asked if it was something she wanted, she responded that she did, and that was the end of it. 
     Until yesterday, She emailed me saying that if I wanted to I could talk to her she just couldn't add me on Facebook because of her family. 
She's Arabian if that puts things in perspective, sorry I didn't mention that earlier.
I do want to talk to her and I do still like her but it's very strange to email me out of the blue just to tell me I could talk to her also if she is engaged (I put an ""if"" here because there is a huge possibility she is engaged but also a chance she is not, I'll elaborate more if needed) I would feel wrong talking to her because I know I wouldn't want my girl talking to some guy that still had feelings for her.

We went to different colleges, remained close friends throughout, and eventually started dating the summer after graduating. We have since started jobs in different cities (Dallas and Austin – about a 3 hour drive) and have been long distance for most of our relationship. I've kind of always had a thing for this girl but the timing was never right for me to make my move. It was initially hard for her to see me as more than a friend and things moved very slowly in the first few months of our relationship. We went from dating to exclusive to boyfriend/girlfriend and have gradually gotten more serious as time has passed.

 I wasn't used to moving so slowly with a girl and have always been one to fall fast and hard. It took us about 4 months of dating to have sex, which was much longer than I'd waited in the past. As our relationship has been building I've been unsure of if she feels as strongly about me as I feel about her. I feel like I'm always the one making the plans for us to see each other, want to hang out more often with her than she does me, and  want to have sex more often and always have to initiate. We get along great when we're together but making plans to see each other always feels more forced than it should. I feel like I'm going through an endless cycle of wondering if she even cares when we're apart and feeling great about things directly after visiting her or when she visits. 

I'm getting to the point where I think I love her but am afraid to express how I feel out of fear she doesn't feel the same way.

I personally am pretty good with budgeting and finances. Currently she owes the IRS $3k. She just got a part time job working 15 hours a week. She is without a car, however she is free to use my car just about anytime. 
She just brought up the fact that she now wants her own car so she has more freedom and doesn't have to bother me, even though we've discussed multiple times that we would set her up with a car once we move and get situated.

As of right now it does not make sense for this to happen. Her getting a car would cost a few thousand dollars initially, then registration, gas, insurance, and money in case it breaks down since neither of us can afford for her to get a car that's decently reliable. It's caused multiple arguments and I'm getting tired of trying to help her try to manage money and teach her the practicality of situations.

This is her 3rd job since we've been together, so I don't want her to get a car and then be out of a job and have more expenses to cover when she isn't getting an income. Am I being too ""controlling"" over the situation? I'm trying to do what's best for US!

Anyway, I suspect he is a teacher of mine and I straight up tell him so. (I'm pretty naive ok?) He then tells me all this stuff about his identity that is VERY similar to the person I suspect except for a few changed details.  He gives a TON of information about the teacher I suspect that he claims he got from the teachers 'file' by his expert hacking skills.  He gives me a name with the same initials that I cannot connect to anything (another fake name?).  

Suddenly he says he is leaving the country and hitching an illegal ride on a ship out of Seattle.  He claimed he could not live life seeing me be in love with someone else and that he hates everything about his life.  I really just wanted this guy to leave me alone so I am like, whatever.  

Recently I got an email from a 'friend of his' that supposedly helped him get a ride on a ship.  She claimed that he died of a heart attack (this guy was also supposed to be 30 years old) and left me a note that said he hopes to meet me in heaven.

Recently I've realized that I might be poly amorous.  My fiance does not agree with this at all, and I don't blame him.  He can't possibly think of sharing me emotionally or physically with someone else.

After a few days of both parties being miserable (I'm lonely and afraid to hurt him)(he doesn't understand how I'm not enough for him)  we had a cry/talk and he said that if I need to end it I should do it soon so that I don't pull him along, or worse we get married and I get these feelings again.

I was fine, until he fell asleep and I couldn't.  I ended up sexting with another guy I had been talking to lately.

When I'm with him I'm fine and happy, but he works full time and when I'm alone I get...lonely, and I get urges to talk to other guys.

I know I can't have my fiance and this lifestyle.  I just need advice other than ""you should break up with him"".

I don't even know if you guys can give me any advice.

I was also quite prone to jealousy with my then girlfriend and actually paid one of my friends to not flirt with her and start treating her with indifference. I also paid another one of my friends to be nice to her because he tended to be very rude to her. I tried to justify it by pretending that it was a pride free way to give them money around christmas because they didn't have any.

When I was even younger, maybe 8 or 9, I offered a girl (around the same age) at school $20 to play ""you show me yours I show you mine"". She agreed and went first. Not only did I not pay her, I also didn't show mine. I actually ran into her years later when I did have money and for a split second considered giving her the money because I felt bad. Thankfully I realize instantly how insulting it would have been.

1363," I used to run for 30 minutes straight and then stop. Now I have micro-goals and keep going until i hit them. It works for me and may work for you.
TL;DR: If you don't enjoy running, try","I'm 6'3"" and 272lbs. I have a good amount of fat so cardio is not my favorite gym activity but is a must for me. While I personally hate cardio i put my all into it to go as long, as fast, and at as high of a resistance as possible. I used to just hop on and say ""okay im gunna run for 30 minutes"". While this was effective in that i knew exactly when id stop, the entire time i just spent counting down every second until i was done which just made it feel like it was way longer than 30 minutes. Instead i have started to essentially trick myself with micro-goals. Ill start off with maybe attempting to do my first mile within a certain amount of time. Then after that shoot for the next minute mark that is a multiple of 5 for my time. After than i set a new distance goal but keeping them relatively close to the previous goal so as it does not fee like an eternity until i reach it. Eventually you get into a pattern of ""well i cant stop halfway through a mile!"" Then it become ""but i also cant stop until i reach the nearest multiple of 5"". After the first few initial goals you get a bigger desire to just go that little bit farther to hit that next little step... And then the next one..... And then the one after that. Today i hit 5.5 miles in 50 min (new personal best btw). I would have never gone so far had i just initially got on and said ""okay im gunna run for 50 minutes"". There is absolutely no way i would have had the motivation to stay on. So if youre like me and don't enjoy doing cardio so much, create some micro-goals for yourself and see if it helps.

1364," I want to tell my brother how much I miss him, but I know that he will most likely blow me off, and I don't know what to do. What should I do, or how can I cope with the fact that we won't","(crossposted from r/relationshipadvice)

Long story short, I'm a female who has never gotten along very well with her older brother. Although things have gotten slightly better over the past few years, we've always been at each other's throats, and have even go so far as to get in quasi-physical fights. Part of my attitude towards him is that he has a huge sense of entitlement where he thinks he deserves everything in the world and doesn't appreciate what people do for him, and this has driven me crazy forever.

Last night I had a dream in which my brother died and my grandma called me up to tell me. I woke up from this dream absolutely sobbing and realized that, although I'm not proud of his decisions, (quitting school, lack of permanence in jobs) I still look up to my brother and love him.

Here's the issue: I would like to tell my brother how I feel, but I know from previous experience that he's just going to blow me off. Chances are, if I wrote him a letter, he would show it to his friends, or burn it, or whatever. Part of this probably stems from the fact that he thinks of himself as ""immortal"" and so he won't accept the whole ""I would miss you if you were gone"" talk.

What should I do? Just try to accept the fact that we won't have a relationship, try to talk to him knowing that he will most likely blow me off, what?

We've been broken up for almost 3 months now, so I've had time to get over it.

Anyway, this new guy I'm seeing is a musician (deal breaker for me, as I've dated a few musicians, and my latest ex is a musician [lots of touring, shows, and generally self-absorbed])...I get along great with this guy, and he has a job, and music is more of a hobby, so I let it slide. However, the more we talk, the more it seems like he wants to pursue music. 

Secondly, I'm going to school, and plan on being able to provide for myself and my possible future children, but it would be nice if the person I'm with could help provide as well if necessary, and this guy I'm with dropped out of school after two years...he's contemplating going back, but again, it's unsure.

Thirdly, and this is completely superficial of me and is by no means a deal breaker, but for some reason it's bugging me (I think I'm just looking for reasons to not be with him)....but he wrote me, not really a love note, but a mushy note nonetheless, and he wrote ""your"" instead of ""you're""....

I really like this guy (m25, btw) and we get along really well. I'm letting things slide because I think I'm just jaded after my last relationship, but I'm taking things slowly just to make sure.

I gave her everything she wanted but the reasons she gave for breaking up were: 
* I wasn't social enough according to her: Yes i was silent around her friends because they were strange people and i didn't get a good feeling with them. With my friends and random group of strangers that happen to be at house parties i get along just fine and talk to everyone

*I gave up on things: I don't know where she got this from, i usually don't give up on things but it seems she made up for herself that i did.

*future: she thought we wanted different things for the future, even though we had discussed it quite a lot and we seemed to want the same things. and still, she has 5 years of college ahead...way too early to start thinking about things like that, our view would prolly change anyway

right now we still talk everyday...i really need it because i don't have anyone else to talk to. My best friend is busy and every time he has he spends with me, but still i can't stop thinking about her...the way she made me smile, her beautiful eyes...i just... :( i feel broken and alone...my plans thrown off the table...i'm so unsure about everything right now. Everything reminds me off her because she used to be here all the time. 

I got 5 exams this week, i'm going to fail most of them. I really don't want to but my mind keeps wandering off into the past and i cry for most of the days , i even cry myself to sleep each night. 

we still text all day and thats the only thing keeping me from crying, i feel alone if we aren't.

Then, within the next 5 minutes of completion, would completely destroy it and take it apart. I did this because younger me realized there will be times in life where you will spend so much time into something, put a lot of effort and yourself into it, only to something to happen that would deem all that hard work useless. As the years went on, there'd be a few other times where I would do the same. Another example is when I was in junior high, I played World of Warcraft almost all of the time. I believe I started playing after the first expansion came out so I forgot what the cap level was then. But of course, I'd put in a lot of time into that game, eventually hit the top level, and then proceed to delete my character. But, here's when I realized for the first time that all of this payed off. In my senior year of high school, I was typing a paper for my first semester final. I had spent the last week or so putting together this 13 page paper (brainstorming, writing down notes, organizing ideas, etc.) that was going to count for 25% of my final grade. So then one day I began to finally put it all together in my paper. As I was finishing up the paper, my computer crashed and microsoft word failed to recover my paper. This did not phase me one bit. I simply turned my computer back on and began typing it again from scratch, ended up getting an 80% on it.

1381," I got super drunk and hooked up with a guy, but I don't remember most of it. Should I tell my boyfriend, and if so, how should I tell him, and when?","I'm a 24 year old girl in a committed long distance relationship of a year and a half. My boyfriend is on the other side of the country, but will be moving to be close to me in a few months. Last night, I got super drunk at a campus event and ended up walking back with a guy friend. He was drunk too, and came inside and we were just hanging out and watching TV. I don't really remember most of what happened because I was super drunk, but I think we almost started making out. He stopped and asked if I still was dating my boyfriend.. and I am, so luckily we stopped. Nothing really happened besides a lot of cuddling and flirting, but I feel like I had completely no idea what I was doing and if he hadn't said anything, I'm worried we might have hooked up.  HELP... the question is, should I tell my boyfriend? I don't have a lot of friends out at school here, and this is one of my only guy friends, so I don't want him to hate him forever. There's also a chance this would cause irreparable damage in my relationship. Did I cheat? Do I tell him? SOS Reddit

1382," Boyfriend died 9 years ago, his family lives across the country, I want to contact his little sister on FB, but don't know what to say to her, or if I should contact her at all.","Okay, so here's my story: 9 years ago my boyfriend died. He had been out of contact with his family during most of the time we were together, and they lived across the country so I had no opportunity to really get to know them at all. When he died, I flew across the country to go to the funeral and I was able to meet his mother, father, and sister. I was all kinds of messed up at the time and I have since lost everything that I ever had regarding the whereabouts of his family. I have periodically searched the internet to see if I can find them, and recently his little sister opened a FB account. I really want to get in touch but I don't know what to say, and I don't want to upset the family. I should mention that his family was very gracious with me and they were thankful of my relationship with him, so I know that they don't hate me. What do I do? Do I send this girl a message? What should it say? Thank you for any insights.

TL;DR: I want to ask my FWB","I've been friends with her since I started college at 21 and we are both seniors now and we have been FWB since the last 4 years on and off. Well she came over earlier in the week and talked to me about possibly dating and maybe having it turn into something long-term. The thing is, the way she has been, I never would think of her as someone I'd want to date. She isn't that fat (I would guess 160 lbs, 5'7'') but I date women that are more active and into physical activities that I like to do (mountain bike, jogging, swimming).

Part of doing these types of things also gets you in shape. I would wish she would at least get a little more fit. I just don't want her to get the basic notion that I don't want to be with a fat chick. So, how should I talk to her about this, I had never had to deal with this kind of talk before and have no idea how I would bring it up.

I met my friend a year ago and we instantly clicked. She's had a troubled past, coming from an abusive home, and having been in two marriages with physically abusive men. When I met her she was recovering from her second divorce, finally living on her own with her three kids.

I love her, she's quickly become a rock in my life, she's so helpful and caring. But she really, really has man issues.

She met her most recent man online. He comes from outside the country and has his own company. They got talking. He wanted to launch his product in our country, and they met up while he was here on a business trip. She insisted it was all casual. Then he offered her a job. She was out of work and money was very tight. She also seemed happy he thought she was capable. She did not get a contract but started working anyway. He then moved in with her, and so did the company inventory. From then on it got worse and worse. He yells at her and her kids. He does absolutely no work, but gets angry whenever he thinks she does not do enough. He gets angry whenever she comes to see me, he dislikes me and blames me whenever she talks back to him, saying I put ideas into her head. He pays her absolutely no money, whatever money he has goes to gambling.

I'm so concerned for her. She often sits here bawling her eyes out because he picked another fight. I try to gently tell her this is not healthy. She's often said she's going to kick him out or do something about it, but then the next day she tells me they worked it out and they are making progress. And then a few days later the cycle starts again.

This shit is tearing me apart. I don't know how to help. As I said I try to gently tell her this is not good, but when I push it too much she gets kind of defensive. I just don't know how she can possibly not see what I'm seeing...

1385," I want to ask my new boyfriend why there was stuff from his ex in his apartment, but I don't want to seem accusatory or rude. What should I say to him and how should I bring up the subject to him?","I have been dating this great guy for about a month now. We have started seeing each other every weekend now. Last weekend he invited me back to his place. Before i went in he stopped me and said something like: 
Look i moved in here with my ex and some of her stuff is still here, i know it's weird. I would feel very awkward in your place.

I was quite baffled and we went in.
The stuff that was left was a coat in the hallway, a few bits and bots in the bathroom and two frame collages of pictures of her and him and who i guess are her friends and family on the wall. As well as some girly candles and bedsheets. There were no signs of her in the bedroom so i am pretty positive she does not still live there. 

Right now i am kicking myself for not asking why they were still there where she clearly left everything and why hadn't he moved them? Returned them? Cleared them away? It makes me worry he is still hung up over his ex. I really want my questions answered but I felt at the time it was too rude to ask. 

I am seeing him again this weekend and I want to ask him about it. I was wondering if anyone had any advise about what i should say and how to bring up the subject. I do not want to seem like I'm worried or attacking him! I have no idea how to bring up the subject other than being blunt or waiting for him to explain.. 

I know this might be considered a red flag, but he is such a nice guy i want to give him the benefit of the doubt and let him explain before i read into it too much.

I'm looking into studying with the ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) largely because huge amounts of alleviated stress concerning fees, living costs and the such.

So my question is: What do you do in your job? It's a huge question for me, because I would absolutely love to be a job where I was directly working on aircraft (helis especially) in a mechanical or design aspect, or flying around in them (though I'm short sighted, so the odds aren't good). 

Basically, I would absolutely loathe to be sitting behind a desk all day directing people, or thinking about some completely boring but probably terribly important aspect of flying; I'd much rather get down and dirty with an engine or maintain aircraft, or design parts or engines to be more efficient/faster/stronger.

For my year 12 subjects, I'll be studying physics, chemistry, english, systems engineering and all three levels of maths from low level to high level. I'm no dummy by any means, and do very well academically, so it's not a huge issue in that department.

I'm wondering whether any of you can tell me about what you do or give me advice on what career path I should perhaps focus on instead, whether it be mechanical engineering, or electrical engineering, I really don't know.

1387," Girlfriend is unhappy with her weight and doesn't feel comfortable with herself, but doesn't want to talk about it. What can I do to make her feel better and make her more comfortable with her body?","My girlfriend is 22 years old and recently has put on weight despite going to the gym a lot and eating healthily more recently. Honestly, I'm completely fine with it. In fact I've grown to love (maybe even prefer) the way she looks now and still find her very attractive, though if she wanted to lose weight I would be just as happy.

She's recently became especially self-conscious about it, though says she's never been happy even when she was quite thin, and it's having an effect on our sex life – she doesn't feel comfortable with herself and so isn't interested in sex. More importantly though I think it's making her unhappy, but a lack of sex can obviously have some effect on a relationship.

So we talked about it recently, and firstly I told her how I loved the way she looked even if in her opinion weighing more was less attractive. That didn't help.

Then I said well maybe you need to try and be more comfortable with it and kind of fight the feeling of thinking 'I hate the way I look' when looking in the mirror'. She said she's already tried doing this a lot, and it didn't work.

Finally I suggested we just talk through why she felt so bad and she said that this only made her upset and didn't help so she didn't want to.

The thing she keeps repeating is that she doesn't care what anyone else thinks it's that she isn't happy with herself and that's what's getting her so down.

I feel as if I can't do much more at the moment, so I was looking for some insight into what might be the best thing to do next?

Is there a way I can make her feel better?

Or is there something I'm missing or not understanding about the whole situation?

Is it a good idea to switch again to a major that is more in","Hi guys and girls, I'm looking for some advice. When I was a freshman, I started college as a Biology major. I didn't have a plan but it sounded like a good place to start. After having to withdraw from my math class and then barely passing the second time around, plus barely getting C's in my core classes,  I decided to switch to English. It was an obvious choice because of all the extra English classes I was taking an acing. I do know the risks and challenges of switching to such a limiting major. I'm now a junior and have been looking at graduate schools for Library Science for a year now. However, the more I think about it, the more I wish I would have switched to Psychology. I've been thinking about having a Psychology minor but I love it so much that it's starting to bother me that I'll be only minoring in it. I really enjoy it, I'm good at it, and there are many more employment opportunities that actually utilize the major. I'm not looking for criticism for my decisions. I'm looking for useful advice, anecdotal evidence that I should or shouldn't switch again, and maybe a little reassurance that I'm not the only one feeling this way. I'll be talking to my adviser later this week and then doing some academic counseling. Thanks for reading.

What would *","Over the Christmas break, I asked out a coworker who I've really grown to like. The first date wasn't bad, but wasn't amazing either. However, the second date, two weeks later, went really well, and she said she was open to the idea of another date. 

Because I'm really interested in her, I want to go out with her again this weekend (our last date was on Friday), but a couple people, including my sister, say that I might be going a little bit too quickly and I should maybe wait another week, if not two. Since we are both college students and have different days off, the weekend would be our only time to go out without planning ahead by at least a week. 

A week in between doesn't feel like too short of a time to me, but I'm still not sure how much she may or may not be interested in me, or what type of relationship she might be looking for. I'm interested in her enough that I'm feeling just a little bit impatient and don't want to wait too long before asking her out again. I also despise playing mind games, so that rationale for waiting just doesn't seem compelling to me. 

With all that said, I don't want to go too fast with this, because I know (through the work grapevine) that the last guy who she liked killed his chance with a mixture of moving a little fast and getting ahead of himself and thinking they were basically a couple after two dates (the second half of this seems to have been a bigger factor than the first half).

What would you recommend doing? I see her four days a week with work, but we don't really get to interact for more than five or maybe ten minutes each time. Should I wait another week so that she doesn't feel like I'm coming on too strong? Or is it not really a big deal, and I can go for it? How do I wait without driving myself crazy or psyching myself out? Thanks for any input.

He is a total douche and I need to deal with it.","I have known him since my freshman year of college and we have been pretty good friends since then but it was not until moving in with him that I realized he is a total ass.

 He has no respect for my things, he ALWAYS expects something in return for anything that he does no matter how small it is and will ask. For example occasionally he will buy some sort of food or something for the whole house and then hold it over everyone's head until he receives something and on top of that he takes my food.

 I know he takes my food because I have caught him twice. I called him out both times and still notice things going missing. The other night I caught him taking some of my food, called him out and then kinda yelled at him, the result: I'm pissed and he does nothing. He literally does not care whatsoever. 

Not only this I constantly see him use my other roommates and they have noticed food go missing also. He is really just concerned with himself and does not give a shit about anyone around him.

 He constantly asks how he looks, goes on for hours about the most insignificant things in his day, never asks about anyone else, and on top of all that if you say anything negative to him he takes it super personally. His ego is more easily bruised then anyone I've ever met. 

All this adds up to me really not liking being at our house. I stay at school for long hours and really it is mainly to avoid him. I need some advice on how to deal with someone like this and need to make it through the year because we already signed the lease until June.

He did not grow up celebrating Christmas (he was raised Jewish) and is now Atheist so he feels like he should be able to opt out of participating with my family. Let me be clear that my family is not religious by any means. We do not go to church and Christmas for us is about spending time with each other as a family and eating good food. The most religious thing that goes on is my mom puts out a small nativity scene that has been in her family for years. 

I asked my husband when he would like to go with my mom and brothers to look for our Christmas tree. He told me he doesn't want to come and I asked him if he meant tonight or in general and he said in general. He said he really doesn't see the big deal about him opting out of the Holiday all together. Meaning that he won't be with us when we eat our traditional Christmas Eve and Christmas meal. He doesn't see why I could be upset about this, but for me it is something we have to go through every year and I wish he would just be an adult, suck it up, and deal with it. There are plenty of times we do things we aren't thrilled about just to make the other person happy and I feel this should be one of those times.

Yesterday was our anniversary. We are in his home state staying with his mom for a short vacation. We went out to a concert with friends two nights ago and then decided to drive back to his mom's city a night early instead of staying to see another band. This meant we would be going to see one of his favorite sports teams on our anniversary rather than going to a concert (which I personally would enjoy more) or out to eat. I'm not a fan of this sport but I've gone with him to games before and I don't mind going, nor did I mind going this time. 

Nonetheless. He treated it like any other day. Barely talked to me (we went with two of his friends, a guy and his fiancée). I paid for a lot of our food and such because I wanted him to have a good time. I even bought him a jersey as a gift. He was thankful but still aloof. 

After the game we went back to his friends' house to hang out for a while. Around 11:30 I asked to come back home since we had been up til 4am the night before and I am now pretty sick with a cold. He seemed irritated and made me wait another hour. 

This morning he got up again at 8 and left to go watch soccer with his same friend, so I've been laying here trying to not be sick. 

I guess I feel disappointed. I'm not asking for much. I didn't want a gift and I didn't have a problem going to the game or hanging out with his friends... It just would have been nice if he told me he loved me or something?

Well today, I was called away to fix a couple issues away from my core. And as is pretty normal, when I returned, some of the production guys were having a meeting, one of whom had snagged my chair. 

No big deal right? Not enough places for everyone to sit, so he just took a free chair. Perfectly acceptable. 

He knew this was the chair I have been using the past few days, he knew this was my spot (generally everyone in my role babysits their equipment lest someone starts unplugging things), and he knew that I was patiently standing at the table I normally sat at, patiently waiting for the meeting to end and for me to reclaim my chair. 

So the meeting ends, everyone starts filing out back to the broadcast truck/stadium/set ect..this guy takes my chair...places it about 5 feet away from me...and proceeds to place his briefcase on said chair...then walk away.

I have home after taxes just over 2k a month. 

My fiancé is in medical school and 26. He has no undergrad debt, but also no savings. At the end of it all with interest, he should be 150k in debt. He is leasing a car right now (just a sedan). 

We rent out our second bedroom and we pay rent and utilities which amount to about 600$. 

No credit card debt. We utilize the cash blue preferred Amex and use the cash back for Christmas gifts so we don't have to budget for that. 

We always have at least 1k in emergency funding for our two dogs (and us I suppose... But we are both insured in everything).

I have never been irresponsible with my credit. Never missed a credit card payment.

I was thinking of slowing down my student loan payments (I've been paying any left over money outside of the emergency fund into it) and putting that  money into a wedding savings account.

She reported it to the police and they have been going through all the messages after taking my phone, iPad and laptop, and have found more inappropriate images and pictures. They called my mum last night and she smashed my school tablet in a rage, then apologised after I told her about my ex boyfriend who abused me sexually and physically.

Basically I'm not sure what to do. They say there is a chance that the 20 year old male will be let off with a caution which is ideal for me but the situation at home now is abominable to say the least. She won't let me go anywhere, threatens to strip my room and take off my door and also accuses me of lying about my ex and calls me a prostitute. Also, I have a history of self harm and a couple weeks ago she made me strip and yelled at me for the scars. Any advice??

1401," my dog freaks out when people shake hands inside the house, but not outside. She doesn't have any problems with other people in the house, just when it's two people shaking hands. What is the problem here and how can we solve it","We don't often have guests over to our house, but we threw a party last month and I noticed my dog displaying a weird behavior. 

Whenever two people shake hands inside the house, my dog will run over to them, jump up, and try to nip the handshake. She freaks the hell out. At first I thought she was just getting anxious because people were acting excited and loud in the house, but then my husband and I tried shaking hands in front of her when no guests were around, and she did the same thing!

She's an 8- or 9-year-old lab mix. Female, spayed, adopted from the shelter two years ago. She doesn't display any other behavior like this in the house. She's a little leash-reactive, but we've made HUGE progress on that. When we are home with her, she is calm, loving, and well behaved.

So, /r/dogtraining, any ideas on how to get my dog to be calm when people shake hands? I have searched the web and this sub for my problem, but all that I'm seeing are threads on how to teach one's dog to ""shake,"" as in the dog and the human. 

What is going on here? Again, if two people shake hands, she runs up to the hands, jumps and attempts to nip the hands that are shaking. If she doesn't make contact, or if me or my husband intervene, she will sit and stare at the shaking hands, making weird yelping noises like she's extremely stressed out. 

My dog gets a LOT of exercise, so this is not the problem. I'd appreciate any insight you have.

I've been with my gf for about one year and things were going okay, but a few months ago I started losing interest because I'm feeling very unfulfilled with our communication and ambitions.
And I've been contemplating breaking up with her for those few months and I'm having trouble finding the right way to do it. But a month ago she brought me to a family gathering where I met her cousin and we immediately hit it off, same taste in music, books, movies, TV, art, ideals, philosophy and ambitions. And we've been talking online almost everyday since then.
I'm pretty sure she likes me and I know I like her a lot. And she knows that I've been going through stuff with my gf and she told me last night that she thinks that I talk to her too much when I should be talking to my gf to try to work things out and she doesn't want to be a contributing factor if I and my gf break up.
Which I totally understand but I'm just having trouble on what I should do now.
I'm not happy with my current relationship and I want to break up but she is very attached to me so I can't figure out a way to let her off softly and I know if I make her heartbroken then there is no way I can continue any sort of relationship with her cousin.

How can I get over this and how can I deal with my insecurities better in general?","Let me start by saying, my boyfriend is a great guy. It has been a rocky relationship but time and time again he has proven that he is willing to put all the effort that is needed to make things work. He has helped me became a better person, helped me get over a lot of issues I have had with myself, and has always been there for me. He is never cheated, and is very open and honest with me. He's an frequent Reddit user so I can't really go into specifics, but incase he does fuck it, it'll be a nice reminder to him how much he means to me. 

So what's the problem? Well to give a bit of background my parents divorced when I was little, not only that but for some reason I was mostly surrounded by unhealthy relationships. I don't dwell on it much and have never thought it affected me. 

Sometimes this irrational fear comes over me that he must be fucking me over, more specifically that he is cheating on me. I have no reason to believe it other than I can't tell who he occasionally texts. And so far the times I have figured out, it's just friends or family. It's completely ridiculous. Just certain situations or thoughts trigger this overwhelming feeling that he must be doing something wrong. There's very little I can do to shake it off. 

I must emphasise that this is mostly comes from me just over thinking. 

I want some advice on how I can get out of the habit of thinking this things, or dealing with this insecurities. I know this could be something that ends our relationship and I really don't want that.

I received an email today to my gmail account at 1:39PM Eastern Standard Time and immediately clicked on the link to try to buy tickets. Alas, they were sold out even though I clicked on the link within 10 seconds of receiving the email.

Then I reread the email and saw that the tickets went on sale at noon, 12:00pm and felt cheated because I hadn't even received the email until 99 minutes after the sale was open to the public. No wonder the concert was sold out so quickly.

Doubling back to the email I noticed that the timestamp it was received by my gmail account was 13:39:09 Eastern Time, but that it had been sent from Mastercard with a timestamp of 10:21:12 Eastern Time. 

**What's up with the 3+ hour delay?**

Can someone look at the email header and help me understand it a little better? I uploaded it [here] I'm just curious if the delay would have innocently been caused by Mastercard's bulk-mail sending service, Gmail delaying delivery for some reason, or whether it was a scam from the get-go with Mastercard knowingly sending me an email for a concert that they knew would be sold out before I possibly could have clicked the link......

He worked as a manager for one of the larger general contracting companies back home. It was his job to ensure that job sites were completed on time, within budget, and within code. The company he worked for often built low income and government subsidized housing. In many cases the owners and VPs would cut certain corners that would make the project legitimately cheaper, but still projected the same expenses and pocketed the rest. 

While my dad noticed this going on he kept written documents of everything, in the event something occurred. He was also not getting paid for many hours he was working at the time; treating him as though he was on salary, while still on hourly wages. 

He came to me asking what he should do. In his email there is proof of much of the happenings. It is a company computer that uses outlook, and needs to be returned along with the truck tomorrow.

I don't know about this guy as my supervisor"" in an obviously sarcastic ""just messin' with ya"" tone. He didn't respond and the other trainee next to me said something to the effect of ""ohh, denied. Typical supervisor.""

1422," I have a 6 month supply of Celexa (Citalopram) in Germany, but my doctor there is on holiday and won't be back for a while. Can I switch to Lexapro (Escitalopram) in the","To any doctors here - 

Hi. I've been on Citalopram (Celexa) since May. 20 mg. For anxiety. I've been a student in Germany since 2009. Last month when I flew back home to India for a holiday, my doctor there replenished my medication stock for me. But he gave me a 6 month supply of Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead of Citalopram. Escitalopram is just the S enantiomer of citalopram, and apparently has better anti-anxiety effects. 

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

1423," I told my new boyfriend that I grew up as a super religious Mennonite girl who had never had sex before, when in reality I grew up in a mostly Amish/Mennonite town and had had sex before. He doesn","Long story short, I was very romantically/sexually inexperienced before I met my boyfriend ""Evan."" I wasn't a virgin, but I was definitely a late bloomer and I'd only had sex twice before. I met him when I was 24 and liked him right away, but I wasn't interested in a relationship; I just really wanted to get more experience.

One night we started hooking up, but I panicked and got terrified that he'd be turned off by my obvious lack of experience. I made up a lie on the spot about how I had grown up Mennonite (not quite Amish but close) and how I had only left the church recently so I'd never had sex before. In retrospect I realize how stupid that was, but I was honestly never planning to see him again and I was just really nervous in the heat of the moment. We hooked up, it was good, and then we parted ways. 

About 5 months later I ran into him randomly and we decided to go out again. That quickly led to us dating, and me falling for him. We've been together almost 2 years now, and Evan still thinks I grew up as a super religious Mennonite. (I did grow up in a mostly Amish/Mennonite town, but my family was not religious at all.) We don't talk about my childhood much, and I think he assumes it's a painful subject. He's met my mom briefly, but she and the rest of my fam live on the other side of the country. I told him the rest of my family also left the church. 

So I know this makes me a terrible person, and the moment is long passed to tell him the truth. I just really did NOT anticipate it escalating like this, and by the time I realized that I really cared about him, it was sort of too late to come clean. 

Evan is very easy-going and finds humor in the weirdest situations, so as naive as it may be, I'm kind of hoping that if he could understand the reason behind the initial lie, he might eventually think it was funny. Or not. I don't know what to do.

1425," I received a raise effective 10/1, pay rate was listed lower than what I was promised by 4 cents an hour. No one from the company has contacted me since then and no one has explained why the pay rate was off cents on the dollar","I'm not really sure where to go with this but this seems like a good place to start. In 9/2015 I received an email from my project mgr that I was getting a raise effective 10/1. I am paid bi-monthly and received my first paycheck with the new rate on 10.22. However, the pay rate was listed lower than what I was promised by 4 cents an hour. I work from home and have no in person contact with anyone from the company, so I emailed my direct supervisor who found a contact in HR for me to email.

I sent that person an email on 10/23, and received a reply a day later that the pay rate on my paycheck was a mistake and ""we don't know why some paychecks were off cents on the dollar but it is definitely a mistake and will be fixed retroactive to October 1st."" I have not heard a single thing from this woman since that time. 

I waited a month and emailed her again asking why it was not fixed. I did not receive any response from her so I emailed my boss. She immediately emailed the project manager (who emailed me the raise info to begin with) and was told he would ""run it to the ground"" which she forwarded to me. Still no response directly to me from either of them or anyone else, and no explanation as to why the pay rate was off cents on the dollar.

12/22 I emailed my boss yet AGAIN. I have now received 5 paychecks with the incorrect rate and no one from the company has contacted me in any way to fix the problem or apologize or even make any kind of excuse. There is no reason why it would take this long to fix. 

The minimal amount of the discrepancy is irrelevant to me. I'm just pissed that I'm clearly not valued as an employee. Any amount should be enough to warrant at least a response. Obviously it's not enough money to warrant me consulting a lawyer, but isn't what's happening here fraud? I received a written confirmation of pay rate increase and have not received the pay rate promised.

What should my next step be in trying to solve this issue?

1426," We have a window across the street from a refugee prison in Istanbul, and we want to get the word out that Americans are good people, despite all of our problems.  What can we do to get the point across to the people in the prison","We temporarily have a 3rd floor apartment in Istanbul which is across the street from  what is something like a refugee 'prison' in Kumkapi.  The 'residents' dont seem maltreated, but they are definitely locked in.  While smoking a cigarette out of our window, they started a conversation with us.  It was a very humbling experience.  We weren't able to gather very much, as the security guard(the one with the rifle and the bulletproff vest) pretty clearly told us to stop after a few minutes of yelling back & forth across the street.  The majority of them are refugees from Syria(at least 1 person from Pakistan), and include women & children, and they will be transfered to a refugee camp in 3 days.  Somebody from some window said ""s.o.s.""  The entire encounter lasted only 3 minutes, but may be one of the most moving experiences in all of my travels.  Given all of the current tensions between the US(our country) and the middle east, we feel obliged to continue to communicate with them, although as they are behind both bars and a hatched grate, it'll probably only be one directional.  We want to express our solidarity to them, and let them know that americans in general are very friendly people, depites all of our political/social problems, problems that a lot of middle easterners seem to clearly extrapolate to the entire county.  Our current plans are to procure some posterboard or something similar with the word [Asabiyyah] ( and put it in our window, and also to see if the guards will let us give their children some soccer balls, as they seem to have a small playground.

It's not like they would have guns, just a uniform and a nice car.","As long as it isn't the actual teachers with guns, I don't see the problem. My school (which I went to from elementary through high school) had 2-3 ""armed"" security guards that were either off-duty or retired police officers. They conducted traffic before and after school, made sure there weren't any suspicious people around, and one would always be on campus during the night making sure no one broke in or did anything they weren't supposed to. They were all very nice and their main job was to keep the campus secure, safe, and help out where necessary.  One time I locked my keys in my car and they helped me get them out and a few times I left important class material in my locker and they let me in to get it after hours.  It's not like they sit outside classrooms with AKs and M4s. They just drive around in their security vehicle and say hi, work sports games, and keep children safe from potential predators. We could easily have a budget for 1-3 security guards (not dumb security guards, but off-duty/retired cops) if we cut back on our excessive military or other government spending.

He was a liar","A couple of months ago I found out that he lied to me. I didn't see it coming, because there was almost no indication. 

He told me that he had been employed, and would be working part time every Tuesday and Thursday while he was in school.

This went on for a couple of months (maybe February to April).

1431, Friend of mine has a history of abuse and now has several bruises on her body. What can I do to support her and get her to get out of the relationship (or at least get her to get help)?,"A friend of mine from high school texted me tonight saying that she thought she was ""haunted"" and that she was seeing figures in the night that would ""charge her"" and ""keep her (and her child) awake at night."" She went on to say that she woke up everyday with a new bruise. I thought she was being a bit dramatic as I have known her to be sometimes. But then, she texted me a picture where it was clear that she had several bruises on her body. I think she was trying to ask for help in a way. 

This isn't the first time I've suspected she was in a bad situation, just the first time that I am ""potentially"" seeing evidence. I haven't actually seen her in about four years although we live in the same city. We text occasionally but we don't have consistent communication. 

I know she is in a complicated relationship/marriage (I'm honestly not sure of their actual status). She has mentioned to me times where she felt threatened to the point where she would hide from him. There are other details that I can't go into that, in hindsight, are huge red flags. So I'm pretty sure that the abuse is real and ongoing. 

Now that I am confronted with what seems like evidence, I feel highly compelled to do something. Especially knowing that a child is involved. No, I'm not going to march over to her place and try to rescue her or anything that dramatic without knowing more of the situation. I'm really thinking what can I do to support her as a friend and point her in the direction of getting out. 

I don't know that involving any domestic abuse groups right now would be the right move, especially without me having talked to her about it first. I don't know how such organizations operate when it comes to anonymity. I highly doubt it be an effective move unless she was 100% committed to getting out of the relationship (which I only suspect she does, I don't know how emotionally complicated it truly is).

I've dealt with some hardcore drama in my life but nothing quite as intense as this. Just need a bit of advice.

I've recently started dating a close friend of mine and it's become long distance very soon into our relationship.  I'm 21 and she's 19, and we're both in university.  

To give some context, we had known each other for about a year, and were previous coworkers. In May, we began to hang out a lot, and although I had no intentions before, I ended up developing feelings for her. Come November, I told her of these feelings and we had decided to become an official couple. 

However, at the beginning of January, I left across the world to Taiwan for an 8 month long internship. This was very crushing for us as we were still in the honeymoon phase of our relationship, but there was nothing to be done about that. 

Now it's been about 2 weeks, and I don't know how to deal with our relationship. I don't speak the language here and am in the process of learning, so while I'm not busy with work, my girlfriend is really the only thing that's on my mind, and I'm always ready to talk with her at moments notice. However, she does have her own life back home, and friends to support her, and I often get the feeling that I am being neglected or forgotten while she goes and has fun with her friends.

Obviously this is not the case, as she needs to live her life without me as well, but lately I've been pressuring her to put more effort on her part, which has led to quite a few arguments. 

We text and chat every single day, and I'm always craving more. I know that she's putting in effort for me and misses me, but I don't know how to accept and deal with the fact that she needs to live her own life. 

Please give me advice on how to distract myself here and let my girlfriend live her life! Thanks everyone!

Me and my gf have been dating for almost 16 months, the whole time its been a relatively smooth and very productive relationship. We get along great, lots of physical attraction, the whole shebang. 1 month in I fucked another girl, felt really bad about it, told her and we were able to work through it.

She calls me drunk from her vacation and everything is great as usual and we talk about a lot of things including our ideas of what love is and if i've hooked up with anybody since shes been gone (~2 weeks since we've seen each other). I haven't but said that i had been feeling very sexual and thought about fucking a girl i met last night. She then asks me to tell her a secret. In my infinite wisdom, i say last new years i pecked another girl for a midnight kiss and she instantly got really sad and angry. Now this throws the whole relationship into question for her and shes saying i should take the rest of the break off and hook up with who i want.

She had a tough childhood,"I feel like at the start of the relationship me and her had lots of physical attraction and lots of physical contact (Massages, back scratching, more hugging, more kissing) and recently it feels like she doesn't want to do that kind of thing with me at all. 

Sexual acts like HJ, BJ and such have very much so declined to non existent. Because she ""doesn't feel like it"" where as I am almost always more then happy to do that sort of thing for her. It also feels like all those little things that she used to do cause I felt that she did them because she loved me but now she doesn't feel like it. I love to spend time with her and love her very much but I honestly feel that she is starting to not love me anymore. 

I do lots of things with her, as much as I can but I feel that she is almost selfish and feels like I am a man and don't need that affection and that attention because im a guy. I'm not the most experienced with relationships but I feel like I know a good amount. I feel like I try so hard to make her happy and spend time with her but when it comes to a few things that I like or want to do, it becomes a hastle or a fuss.

She had a little bit of a tough childhood and I think she is an amazing person and she hasn't learned to show affection very well or to accept it very well so sometimes I feel like that has more then a little bit to do with some of that stuff. Maybe im over thinking and were just in a rough patch ATM but just wanted a possible different angle. I don't feel that she is a cheater and I think she is loyal but sometimes when she is texting or something she kind of hides her phone or she makes it a bigger deal if I try to peek or something.

Today I followed John's advice and asked my FA whether he's a fiduciary and what my fees are: he isn't, and 2%. He stressed that my portfolio is actively managed, which is worth the fees; I shot back that statistically, actively managed portfolios don't outperform index funds.

My FA talks about ETFs and mutual funds a lot but I don't think I own any of those. 

I told my FA that I want to lower my fees to 1% at most, that I want index funds and don't believe in active management, and that I felt that if he truly had my best interests in mind, he would have told me that index funds are a saner, cheaper option that performs just as well.

He didn't give me a specific reason that he went over, and I didn't want to come off jealous by asking why.)

Two weeks ago on Tuesday, I received a one line email from this company's HR rep, asking if I could fly out for an interview (the email address checked out, and the company was legitimate, so I bit) [*sidenote, at first I had no clue who these guys were so I felt a bit odd at first, but then about a week later I realized I applied for the position on Monster about 3 months ago*]. Long story short (and some more really short emails later), I agree, two other people contact me, and on Wednesday morning I receive a call, and my flight, 4 star lodging, and rental car are booked, with my departure being just after noon that day (direct flight, with window seats like I asked).

They ask me to make a presentation about my self and all this other stuff, so I do it all, and prepare myself for the interview. To spare you the grueling details of the 4-5 hour ordeal, the interview went well, and I believe I responded well to all the interviewer's questions, both as a group and individually.

So now, two weeks later, I'm expecting to have heard a response from HR, but still nothing. how long should I wait before it's a bust, considering the lengths they went through to get me there and interview? The position is great, and it'd move my career just as I'd like.

So that was it, if you didn't read, basically I have known her since I was in 6th grade and I've always had a crush on her.  My friend is cool with me dating her, and I think she's amazing.  She has a two year old baby and has had bad luck with guys.  But she's an awesome person and mother.  

I'm 18, just out of high school and going into the military, my girlfriend is same as me, but going into college.  We've been together for almost 2 1/2 years.  It started out awesome, she's smart, and beautiful!  She still is, but she's driving me insane!!  She can't stand a day without me, gets mad when I'm with my friends, and straight up told me she is going to break up with me when I leave for the military!  Ever since she said that I've felt different about her and it made me feel like I don't mean very much.

Every time I talk to her now I just get agitated.  I haven't seen her for a week because she was out of town with family, and I went to see her for a little bit because I had to go home and clean (My mom is intense with cleaning) and she got pissed.  I haven't talked to her since, but I don't really want to.  What do you think I should do?

1443, Dad and Mom don't get along. Mom hits puppy. Dad won't give me custody of puppy. Mom has no job. Dad has a lot of money. Dad said to keep puppy. What do I do reddit?,"Hello Reddit. I'm thirteen. As you can see by the title, my Dad doesn't preferably like my mother. I call her my mother because I don't particularly like her either. In fact, I hate her. Plain and simple. It's not that teen angst or anything. She's just rude and abusive. I mean, she absolutely hates our new puppy. She doesn't understand violence isn't the answer. My Dad has taught me that since I was little. I never provoked fights with my sibling. She hits my puppy when the puppy just wants to play. Of course this just makes the puppy mad. Don't get me wrong, the puppy is really good. She only does her business in the house when nobody's paying attention to her. My Dad and I watch the puppy when we're home. When my mother and sibling are home. They pay no attention to her. She pees and craps on the floor like it's nobody's business. Also, my mother has no job. My Dad keeps our family afloat. If they get into a custody battle (which is likely) I want the ability to testify to my own choice. I should be old enough by then to do so. My Dad said to me he's keeping the dog though. Which is good, I love that little puppy.

We were together for almost 8 years. She broke up with me about 9 months ago because I guess she just saw that I wasn't what she wanted but we never really stopped talking and our conversations/mood hasn't changed (still say 'i love you' etc.). As of a week ago we decide that we're going to try to get back to where we were. We're not considered bf and gf but are trying to reach that and I'm trying to give her as much space as I can. She hated how clingy I am/was. But because of this, I constantly feel like I'm walking on egg shells with her..

So onto the topic, she's at a friends house right and is apparently going to be there til midnight or later which i'm not too fond off but she said she'd text me and she let me know she was there, then there's been no contact since, even after i texted her a couple more times. I can tell I'm definitely not a priority of hers and she doesn't see me as I see her, but am I right to be feeling like this (ignored) or do you think I'm in the wrong?

I love this girl to death, she'd always come #1 in my life with anything, so even if I'm at work or doing anything to keep busy, she'll always be on my mind. Sometimes I check my phone just to make sure I didn't miss a text from her when I *know* she hasn't said anything. So im looking for someones opinion on this..

Hoping to receive some insight here. My dad receives supplementary social security once a month and yesterday, he did not receive his normal income. Unfortunately, both my parents live pay check to paycheck in terms of living, so this was very, very upsetting to my mom.

We filed an appeal in 2011 with payments to be continued during this process and yesterday, the reconsideration appeal was denied, thus losing our monthly income. According to the local S.S. office, they say we cannot appeal this decision. However, on the S.S. website, there are 4 stages for appeals, and we had only tried the first one, reconsideration. 

They ruled him ineligible because he is ""no longer"" disabled, based off a two-minute doctor's visit via Social Security, not our primary physician. My dad is an amputee has various health problems, causing him to not be able to work for long periods of time.

What can we do to go about fighting this? Is this normal?

Any tips on how to deal with this or how to prevent it from happening would be great.","Hey everyone, first off sorry if this has been answered before somewhere - I searched every combination of words I could think of both in this sub and on Google and haven't found anything relevant. 

I've been running somewhat inconsistently for about a year now. In January I ran a 10k with a friend, and did really poorly. I was really disappointed in myself, and felt like I let her down a lot because she refused to leave me behind. In the end, though, she wanted to keep doing races with me, and in an effort to not let her or myself down this time, I've been training pretty hard. One of the things that I realized was that my breathing was really holding me back, and so I started to force myself to breathe in through my nose, out through my mouth. And it's helped. A ton. I'm finding that I'm able to keep a much better pace and go for longer when I run this way.... until a certain point. Then I just hit a wall where my lungs are perfectly fine and could keep up the pace, but the inside of my nostrils are burning. It got so bad last night that I had to stop because it was giving me a headache. 

Like I said, I've done a good deal of searching around using various combinations of ""running breathing through nose burning"" and none of them are getting me close to what I'm looking for. If there's even a name for this that someone wants to throw out and I can do the research myself, I'd take even that. At this point I'm pretty much just going to push through it and hope it's another one of those ""run more"" things someone else posted about today, but if there's a quick solution to this, I'd love to know about it.

TL;DR: New boyfriend is messy and","So, long story short, I ended a long term (5 year) relationship with my ex boyfriend this past summer. He was a really attractive guy who definitely always kept his hair neat and styled, his beard groomed, and always made sure to dress nicely. And by nicely I mean depending on the situation. If we were going out, he always had a button down on and a decent pair of boots or shoes, if we went out to dinner, same thing.. always made it a point to be presentable. 

Fast forward 6 months, and I'm dating a new guy who was my closest friend for about 2 or so years before we started dating. Now, he is a complete 180 from my ex in pretty much every way. Which is totally fine. Our relationship works and I'm happy with just about everything except... the way he presents himself. In a way. He doesn't really keep his beard/mustache groomed, he REFUSES to get a haircut because he ""can do it himself"" but never does, (he means just shaving his head too..) He just got a new job at a corporate office and wears the same sweater over the same 3 button downs (in ridiculous colors btw) every. day. 

He is going to be graduating in May, and I just feel that it's time to grow up. I'm trying to not come off shallow or rude, but I just don't want people to judge him based on his messy appearance. And sometimes I've noticed that it makes me sort of downgrade my own appearance. I don't know if I do this subconsciously, or out of spite somehow.. like ""Fine, you're going to look like a mess, I will too."" kind of thing. I know others have dealt with this type of situation so I'm just looking for suggestions on how to bring this up or how to handle it.

1449, I have feelings for my best friend who isn't interested in me and I'm not sure how to handle the situation. I'm confused as to how to handle the situation and my feelings towards her. It's kinda maddening.,"We met about a year ago through some on-campus activities and we have become very close in the interim. We are bordering on ""best friend"" status if you will...we share our problems and a lot of other fairly personal stuff with each other, talk and text often, and spend quite a bit of time together at social gatherings.

I guess the issue is that I'm fairly certain she isn't interested. I'm not her type from what I've gathered and was basically told I've been ""friendzoned"" in a roundabout way. She is out of my league as well if I'm honest.

And yet, knowing all of this, I am still developing (or perhaps it would be better to say *have developed*) feelings. I would love to have a deeper relationship. I worry about her, and although I have absolutely no right and I know it, it annoys me when she hangs on other guys at parties and such and they hit on her, or talks to me too much about men she's interested in. I'm not willing to say anything because I don't want to damage our friendship so I've taken a hands-off approach, even as I worry myself to death and try to keep an eye on her (she tends to drink a bit too much and get fairly handsy at parties so a lot of guys take that as an invitation even when it isn't.) Last party a guy she thought was just being friendly tried to have sex with her and she got creeped out and the first thing she did was come find me. Apparently I'm just a ""classy motherfucker"" becuase I don't try anything while she's messed up and take care of her.  I'm not sure how I should take that either.

So ya I guess I'm just frustrated and confused. I'm not sure how I should be handling the situation and my feelings towards her.  It's kinda maddening.

Both of my sisters and I get along well, but I find myself feeling like I fall short in supporting them in their high school/college endeavors. These are general hopes, but I want them to be intelligent/independent/rational, to aim for academic success (for the younger, the older is a dedicated student), and to be able to appreciate themselves and their friends (which is sometimes difficult given the at-home tension). Out of those, I guess I'd mostly like to foster their intelligence and emotional strength.

Two years ago, I was in a relationship that I was very happy with--it did have its issues, as all relationships do, don't get me wrong--and saw lasting pretty much forever. Marriage, children, the whole shebang. It was a long distance relationship and on one fateful Tuesday night, completely out of the blue, he broke up with me via Facebook (we rarely ever communicated that way) and then literally never spoke to me again until just recently, again via a Facebook message. I had come to accept that I would likely never hear from him again after many unanswered attempts to contact him, and was proud of myself for responding with just a short ""thank you and hope you are well"" message rather than delving in to all of the emotions I felt upon receiving it.

I have been patient with myself because I know that the circumstances warranted a longer ""recovery"" period before being ready to move on, but there is still rarely a day that goes by that I don't think of him or his family. Sometimes I feel truly overwhelmed with sadness and/or anxiety when I think of him, especially if it crosses my mind that he may be getting married or having children with someone else. It is all I can do to not look him up on Facebook--the only way I'd know now to contact him--and send him some pathetic message about still being in love with him.

Anyway, my brother met a group of people around our age and they decided to hang around with us for awhile. They had been partying the night before so they were in pretty rough shape to say the least. One of the girls in the group was wearing flats and a thin sweater, (in northern Alberta, not that warm this time of year), so I offered her my seat by the fire and a blanket. 

I never usually approach people to talk to them, especially when it comes to talking to women I just get too nervous, so I have very little experience when it comes to this kind of thing. But I could tell that she was interested in me, she kept glancing over at me and every time ours eyes met she would smile and look away quickly. I made what little small talk I could think of to make it as least awkward as possible, and I even managed to muster up the nerve to ask her for her number. It was a pretty big deal for me. 

ANYWAY, my question is how do I proceed from here? My brothers told me that I should wait a few days before I text her, but I've heard that a million times before and I want to know if that is good advice or not. Do I ask her out on a date when I text her? Or do I just make casual conversation for awhile? I have little to no experience in this and I really don't wanna mess this up.

She gets a little angry and says ""I guess taking things slow aren't working for you, maybe we should just take a break."" I said that maybe we should just end it there if she thinks a break is necessary and she retorted by saying I was being stubborn about a break because, even though it usually means breakup, it doesn't with us. She then said ""we can talk more about this in the morning, I love you, goodnight,"" and hung up on me.

Take-home pay (after taxes/12% to 403b): About $2600/month

To emergency fund: $550

I personally think my finances are in good order, and though I have a lot of student loan debt (just under 70k at 6.5%) I'm a candidate for the public service forgiveness program, which will forgive my remaining balance after 10 years.

I also have about 2K in a mutual fund that I hope to add to later; that isn't my focus right now.

Can anyone offer some advice on how to deal with the fact that her ex is going to be","I know this is probably a pretty common question, but so far I haven't read anything that's helped me.

In short, my girlfriend of about 6 months has an ex-husband who she was married to for six years (they split up about three years ago). She had a kid with him and they share custody. I think the kid is great. Her and her ex are on somewhat good terms (mostly because they have to be because of said kid). The biggest problem is I think that I've basically ignored the fact that I now have to not only acknowledge that he exists, but he is going to play a part in her life. Forever. 

For instance, her kid's birthday party is coming up and he's going to be there. I can't not go. I feel like I'm on the verge of having an anxiety attack every time I think about it.

I just want there to be some magic way that I can flip a switch in my brain, and not care anymore. I feel like now that the reality has hit that he's going to be around, I can't even see the word ""marriage"" or hear mention of the notion of having kids because it triggers a huge emotional response where all I can think of is ""there's a guy out there that you're going to forever have to put up with that impregnated your girlfriend, and knows her better than you ever will"".

Our relationship has seriously been pretty much perfect until this (she is one of the most caring and mature people I've met), and now I feel like everything's been upended. I've tried talking to her about it but I don't think any amount of explaining can get her to realize just how badly this is affecting me. And even worse, I know how silly it probably sounds. I want it to stop affecting me and make things go back to the way they were before but I don't know how to make that happen.

Can anyone offer some advice?

My elbow goes flying around, bounces off the mattress, and my well-manicured and rather sharp-nailed finger flies up like a nose-seeking missile and buries itself inside my nostril.

I have allergies and it's not that unusual for my nose to run a little so I don't realize the first drip as the harbinger of doom that it was. Then suddenly it's unleashed and blood is pouring out of my nose like a fountain. 

I don't want it to get all over the sheets so I shove him off and run to the bathroom to contain the damage. Nope, horror-movie scene going on, all down my chest and over my hands, and he's watching me rather concerned while I do that awkward hang-your-face-over-the-sink thing.

My boyfriend knows that this is the effect it has on me.

Is this more pervasive than I thought especially among my generation or am I just unlucky/attracted to girls like this?

The first one I was in a relationship with but had huge trust issues. She(21F) would check my text messages/facebook/reddit accounts/email with no real cause. I didnt ever really notice it but she would tell me sometimes because she felt bad she did it. Like I'd get a text from an ex or something but then id kind of brush the ex of in my response so my gf at the time would read it and feel bad about being suspicious.

The second one(21F) I was hooking up with for 6 months, and while it started as just a hook up, it turned into something more but she refused to call it a relationship or a boyfriend/girlfriend thing because of how she had been treated by past relationships. She ended it because it was feeling too much like a relationship to her after a while and thats not what she wants.

The most recent one(22F) I went out on a few dates with but, despite going really well and her telling me she did like me like that, she said  she didn't want to get into a relationship because of how her last relationships had treated her.

For the girls who told me they didn't want a relationship, it wasn't one of the cases where they were saying it because they just didn't want a relationship with me, neither have been in relationships since they told me they didn't want one.

I'm from the UK and she's in California. We met on [1] /r/BDSMpersonals and have been talking and ""playing"" for getting on for three months. She's coming to the UK as the first leg of a tour of Europe in early July and we agreed to take a few days to basically screw each other's brains out. Ultimately what I'm looking for is a long term relationship but I'm moving cities roughly at the same time she's coming here (phrasing, boom...) so I figured it would work out well.

She's said before that she 's not looking for any kind of commitment and, after an incident where we had to redefine our relationship, we seemed to be OK. I made the cut into the people she actually decided to stick with. I'm starting to come round to the idea of her being polyamourous (I'm really not) but some of her choices of partner definitely freak me out.

Fast forward to today and I get an email where she pretty much says that she's found exactly what she's looking for (roughly speaking it equates to a committed relationship) and wants to put things on hold between us sexually for as long as it takes her to get settled. She still wants to talk to me and still wants to see me in the summer but we can't ""play"" for this indeterminate period of time.

Is there a way that this won't end up with me becoming her friendzoned friend who hears about all the people she's with (often in uncomfortable detail) based on a promise of sex in a few months based on a mutual attraction?

Right now I'm a student. I'm in my 4th year in a very difficult major at a good university, so I have to spend a lot of time studying. I'm also an intern at one of the largest corporations, and I have a job lined up after graduation. So, while future prospects look good, I'm poor as fuck right now. My parents are just as poor as me, so I can't ask for money. I'm living in a super small studio apartment and live very frugally, so I get by. 

My girlfriend is currently in school too, but she lives with her family. They're really abusive and she wants to move out, but her internship is unpaid, so she's poorer than me and can't afford to. Her family often kicks her out then forget about their argument after a week and let her move back in. During those few days, she usually crashes with me. It gets soooo cramped, but she's got nowhere else to go, so I'm fine with it.

The problem is that she eats all my food. I live off of beans, rice, eggs, and ramen noodles. I can't afford to feed us both, even if it's just one week a month. I'm perfectly ok with her staying with me, but I really need her to throw in a few bucks for food or buy her own.

And whenever we do, I try to take care of her before we finish with me. So it usually starts with the (sorry if this is too much detail, but it may be necessary) kissing and fingering, sometimes play with a toy, until finally she reaches a point where her body starts shaking, her legs clamp, and she reels back down.

Here's the thing: she doesn't consider herself to actually orgasm unless she ""squirts"". So, to her, despite all of the aforementioned events happening every time we've been together for the better part of a year-and-a-half.. She thinks she hasn't orgasmed, because she hasn't squirted.

And it's not for a lack of effort. I've tried countless time myself to get her to the point of squirting, watching videos online, reading articles (I've even read in some places that some women can't squirt, others say all can, I don't know who to believe) but she usually tells me to stop after trying for anything longer than fifteen minutes.

She prefers her sexual activities involve me, so she's against the idea of using toys on herself, by herself, so I'm not even able to tell her the best way for us to get her to orgasm is for her to make herself organs so she knows what it is like.

I just.. I am 99% sure that I've been getting her off during our alone time (She admits it feels good), but I can't convince her that an orgasm doesn't need someone squirting. Am I right in thinking that? Am I right in thinking that she's been having an orgasm the whole time?

1471," I break Klondike bars when loading them, making them a mess for the person who didn't pay for them to begin with. It's a great way to get petty revenge on people who don't pay for their shit.","I work at a grocery store, it's one of the medium class places that have people who bag/load your groceries. I am unfortunate enough to have the job of bagging the groceries for ungrateful, holier-than-thou dickbags all day. I have several ways I get petty revenge, ranging from the usual to the creative.

The most common way I try to enact revenge is overloading the bags. You can load them just right, so that if you're gentle the bag is perfectly fine. But, if you like to fling the bag around, like many of these asshats do when putting the bags in their car, the bottom will bust out.

I also do what I like to call the 'fruit slam'. When handling easily bruised fruit, I'll slam it down in their basket. It doesn't visibly damage the fruit, but it leaves them nice and bruised by the time the customer gets home.

The last method is often paired with this one, the 'egg drop'. Here, the eggs may 'accidentally' get banged around a bit while being placed in the cart. Not enough they start to leak out of the carton, but enough that some of the eggs are rendered unusable.

Now, the revenge methods above are usually enough to satisfy my need for petty revenge. But, as anyone who works in retail knows, some people just deserve more than the standard treatment, and my last resort is this;

We all know those [Klondike bar packs] and as we also know Klondike bars are the shit. Sometimes, when loading these, I'll press my thumbs into where I'm holding it. This effectively breaks the Klondike bar, making it a crumbly mess. I've only had to resort to this method a handful of times, but the joy I get from it every time is great.

My parents also told me that they would help me out. She told me that she would support me to accomplish my dream of going to law school.

As with any school financial situation, student loans do not have to be paid on while in school, so that is not an immediate financial issue.

Recently our friend group broke up, so now all our hanging out will have to be one-on-one.

I'm fine with that, but he's asking me to hang out every week or every second week, and I'd like to see him more on a once a month type basis. A long time ago he asked me out and though he swears he's over any sort of crush, sometimes I feel the dynamic remains to a slight extent. I don't want to be hanging out in a pseudo boyfriend-girlfriend capacity, which is what it feels like to me when we're getting dinner together all the time. We're at different life stages and I can't talk about girly stuff with him, plus in general I'm an introvert and probably wouldn't want to hang out that much even if he were a female friend. Final thing is there were a lot of toxic friendships in our group (long story involving a break-up), and he's still friends with everyone and therefore is a link back to all that drama (although there's no hard feelings, the rest of us have decided to go no contact with each other).

How do I tactfully tell him this? I texted him a polite variation of the above a few days ago in an attempt to set boundaries and he responded ""I don't feel the same way, but everyone's different. I totally understand"", but now he's already asked to hang out again. Another problem is that he doesn't have a huge social life (at least, from what I can tell), so part of his motivation is just to hang out with *someone*, I think, so it's hard not to feel bad turning down his requests. At the same time, I'm thinking this dynamic isn't that healthy for either of us.

She is a 4 hour drive away so it's a bit long distance but we've seen each other most weekends. Recently a guy she previously knew started talking to her again and they've begun to hang out a bit.

I not sure how two feel cause this guy has previously told her that he had feelings for her (previous to our relationship). When we began our relationship he stopped talking to my girlfriend until recently (she lived away from him in the same town I'm in) . They caught up for coffee and had a chat.

My girlfriend told me he stayed away because he didn't want to sabotage our relationship. They have hung out twice both times just the two of them at coffee shops. I'm just not sure how to feel.. 

It makes me a bit uncomfortable (which I've communicated with her) but not sure if I should be more worried. I trust her completely... But him not so much. Guess I'm just asking how I should approach the situation.

A couple of months ago my SO's close friend died (i'll call him M), and a week after she made her first visit over there to pay her respects. She had never met this guy, but he was hitting on her for about a month prior to him dying - SO said no and ignored everything from him. He told his family about my SO, but never mentioning she has a BF. She's told me she told them she has a BF, but then one of them posts on her FB wall - ""future wife of M"" with a picture of my SO next to his grave.

Today she tells me, she has agreed to let his family pay half her tuition - but the catch being she has to visit 2 or more times a month (alone). SO told me that they have money to spare, they don't need it so they want to pay half her tuition..

She also mentioned as shes the ""closest"" friend, she is now like a daughter to them. She's spent the last week over there at their place.

I was pretty scared and out of breath when I told my,"I was hanging out downtown with my friend and we were standing at the corner of an intersection to wait for the crosswalk.

I'm talking to my friend when all of the sudden a stream of water (at least I hope it was water) hits me in the face. Confused, I see my friend, mouth agape, pointing at a car that was taking a turn at our corner. Apparently it was full of teenagers and one of the kids in the backseat had a Super Soaker or something.

My first reaction was ""OH HELL NO."" And I suddenly decided to run after the car like a mad man. The blocks in our downtown are fairly short and the intersections off the main path are all 4-way stops. The teenagers kept getting held up by lines of cars waiting at stop signs, giving me ample time to catch up to them.

I could hear them yelling to each other through the open windows, ""DUDE, HE'S COMING AFTER US. GET OUTTA HERE."" At one point, I was able to pound my fist on the trunk of the car. At that point they decided to just book it. They swerved into the oppose lane, run two stop signs, and then I see a cop car in the next intersection give chase to them, flashing lights and all.

I'm gasping for air as I'm watching this unfold. My friend finally catches up to me after a bit and I told him those idiots were going to get pulled over. We decided to bounce ASAP in case anyone began wondering why some Asian guy was chasing after a car full of kids.

What now?","So my friend randomly invited me to a club this last friday and after some time 5 women start dancing next to us, and eventually we go out for a chat. Nothing special, just introductions and small talk about where we live and study.

Did some more dancing and had a little break with minimal conversation at the bar, back to the dance floor, then back out to cool down. Turns out my friend is this girl's friend's half-brother, but the only conversation that goes on is briefly about just that topic before one of the group pulls us all in to grab our coats and leave.

We all head out for the night buses, I try to have a chat with her with little success due to group interuptions and phone calls galore. 

We all managed to somehow pick up some random bloke in a shopping cart because I guess the others were drunk or something, but nothing really exciting happens and we end up at the bus station where me and my friend hug all these girls goodbye and head off to the subway.

We're all friends on facebook now, but I don't know if it's pointless or not to try and get this girl out for a bite on the internet with just this experience... Wondering if I missed my last chance that night. Any thoughts?

I ended up in the shadier parts of town, which freaked me out. I ended up walking halfway around my town, and somehow ended up near a church that's literally a block from my house. I ran home, and my stepmom was on the porch waiting from me. It being Halloween night, she thought that I was out partying. I tried telling her the truth, but she partied as a teen and she thought I was lying. This obviously made me mad, mainly because I'm not the party type.

I really want to date someone who is really good","I'm 27/f and have had two real relationships.  I don't like dating (i.e., auditioning physical relationships with people I barely know) and have had virtually no smaller relationships in between.  Both those relationships started as friendships for about six months, morphed into dating on their initiative (first for less than a month, second for about 8 months), and then we broke up but stayed really good friends for at least a year afterward before either drifting apart or forcibly ending contact.  I'm about to do the latter with the second guy this weekend.  With the second guy we relapsed a few times in that year which has run me through a roller coaster.  The first guy was about three-four years ago.

The really good friends thing is what kills me.  These were both people with whom there was strong chemistry, strong physical intimacy, strong friendship/respect/shared values/compatible interests/compatible intellect/make each other laugh like crazy, and real affection.  In both cases, we worked through some significant life turning points together that were pretty bonding.  I'm being a little on the clinical side for brevity, but in other words: the makings of what I would consider a great relationship.  They didn't want to date me anymore (despite obviously being attracted to me) but wanted to stay really good friends (like, among both of ours top-3 closest friends at the time I'd say).  Both of these guys are sensitive, monogamous, only date one person at a time, don't really date casually, looking to have a family guys. I didn't feel like I wanted to marry them, but I didn't feel like I specifically couldn't do that, and thought there was a lot more good stuff left to live through together.

 On the Global Reddit Meet-up Day June 19th I met a few new people and friended 2 of them on Face Book. Not long after that I broke up with the man who introduced me to Reddit and started talking to one of my new friends. We set up 2 dates, and preempted one by watching fireworks on July 3rd before a cookout at his friends place on the 4th. We have seen each other nearly every day since then, its been 2 and 1/2 weeks.  
In the first few days he gave me a computer. We had a wonderful time on all the planned dates and even just watching movies at his place and eating pizza was fantastic fun. On the 16th he gave me a key to his apartment so I could lock the door after sleeping in and since then I can come and go as I please.  
I had found an apartment to live in from August 2010 to 2011, and he said if I needed help getting together the first months rent and security deposit that he could help me, also he could borrow a truck to help me move, and at that point he jokingly said that I could just rent his other room.  
Now its not joking, it would be economically beneficial for us both if I simply moved in with him and he is serious in his offer.  
We have future plans for a 4 day camping trip and if I do move in we will save enough money that I can go with him on a trip to Jamaica in November.

Background: My brother [22 M] and I [21 F] and my crush [22 M] used to all be good childhood friends. My crush used to say that he wanted to marry me someday (besides the point b/c it was an old childhood promise). My ""friends"" told me in high school that my crush had a summer fling with the girl he recently said was his girl friend. I feel like backing off on this one because of what has been said and done. However, his mom once told me that my crush said not to date anyone other than him because he would get super jealous and beat up any guy that might defile me. His mom also said that my crush had insecurity issues and didn't want to see me when I asked to see him. He also asked me to prom but I wasn't home. However, when I finally plucked the courage to send him a card with my brother that had my phone number written in the card, he was casually said to my brother that he had a girlfriend (who turns out to be the girl my ""friends"" said he had a fling with). I'm not sure if he's lying or not or what to even think of this. The reason I had to give him my phone number was because he recently moved and we had no way of contacting each other. I don't have his phone number or email so I have no way of contacting him unless I go to his house which I would not after what he said. Should I do anything about this, redditors?

He played with me, did horrible things to me, he humiliated me and used me. I felt so ashamed and horrible so when he apologised I went back to him because I wanted to get rid of this horrible feelings. He of course just used this for his next abuse.
Eventually, it was a friend of mine who told me that he is having another girlfriend. They already booked their holidays together, so they must have been together for a while. I was so shattered. When I told him that I know what was going on, he just answered, oh well I don't know why you know that but it is kinda true, I never lied to you or played with you, all the best. He did not even want to talk to me in person anymore. The last time I saw him was around 10 days ago and he pretended to be so in to me. I did not understand the world anymore. I assumed that something is wrong but everytime I asked him about it, he just told me that I am shellfish and that I think that the entire world is turning around me. But he has never done anything wrong. 
They are still together now, he is still so crazy in love. He posts pictures and talks about her openly the entire time. He is so proud of having her (she was his friend's girlfriend before so that is maybe why). He never did that with me, at the beginning he introduced me to his friends but he started to hide me soon after that. 
I still suffer from what he has done to me. I feel humiliated, used and worthless. I feel ashamed and have anger attacks.
I know that I was naïve and stupid but could it be that my ex-boyfriend is a narcissist and treats everyone like this eventually? Or is it purely my fault what happened?

We decided to take a break so he could think, since he said he still had feelings for me.

Google hasn't been very helpful. Here's what I remember of it:
There was a young boy (prince maybe?) And this city that glowed silver and people in the kingdom where this kid lived (if they were lucky) would just wake up with all of their ailments healed, and be glowing, and it would mean that they got to live in this city and be immortal and rich and stuff. The city fell, and the people who lived there had to scavenge for food, and the silver glow on the city turned to a kind of slimy coating on everything. People who got chosen to go to the city now turned all blochy and their hair fell out; they would be disowned and hrown into the crumbling ruins of the city. The people were still immortal, but they didn't heal anymore, so if they stubbed their toe, they had to deal with that pain forever, so needless to say, a bunch of people went crazy pretty quickly. I don't remember the middle much, but in the end this retarded boy from the kingdom (whose parents hid hid him instead of banshin him) who remembered the exact number of feet between various places helped the prince kid figure something out, the people in the city could do magic/teleporting again, and the kid became super smart. An old librarian and a magic book may or may not have been present. Possibly also a princess.

1500," I didn't boil the pigs feet before making broth, now the whole batch smells like feet and I don't know if it's salvageable. If anyone has any tips on how to salvage it, that would be great. If not, I guess","I decided to make ramen for the second time from scratch. A couple recipes I found used pigs feet for the broth, promising amazing results. I ended up referencing a recipe without pigs feet and missed a key step. Apparently the feet need to be boiled briefly to remove any dirt or scum off of them, then that water is dumped. I did thoroughly rinse the feet and made sure there wasn't hair on them, but I didn't do an initial boil. The feet were vacuum packed and looked clean - no dirt that I could see. The problem is that I noticed the feet smelled weird and figured they're feet, they're supposed to smell off, but now the whole broth smells like sour pigs feet. I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be or if this because I didn't do a pre-boil. I'd say the smell is like a sour, almost urine-like smell... not very appealing. The more it simmers, the more the smell is covered by other scents so there's some hope for my broth. It also has pork neck with bones, salted pork belly, various vegetables, and bonito shavings. I would hate to throw out the whole batch, but maybe this is why pigs feet are considered an acquired taste? It's definitely not a rotting smell and I didn't accidentally get pickled pigs feet.

She told me early on she has low sex drive sometimes but I wasn't concerned because it was no issue for the first few weeks. But recently she's not into it basically at all for the past 2 weeks or so. Is it selfish or wrong to be frustrated this early on or should I wait to see if things sort itself out. I asked her about it and she pretty much just said she ""told me she's had low sex drive"" and she'll let me know if I can do anything to turn her on more. She also told me she's as attracted to me as she was before and likes me more everytime we hangout. So it isn't an issue with her not being into me.

I,"Today I thought I was just going to go to class and write a paper.  However, my day went wild from the very beginning.

The first crazy thing that happened was the seizure.  I was sitting in 8 am class with everyone really tired when I look across from me and see that this girl is sleeping.  She looks really into it, leaning all the way back in her chair, head flopped back and everything.  It even sounds like she's snoring.

However, when one of my classmates tries to wake her up, nothing happens.  Meanwhile the snoring is getting more and more guttural.  It starts to sound less like snoring and more like a growling dog.  Suddenly her head snaps up and she starts staring right into my eyes, with the most contorted face I have ever seen.  Her hands are knotting and her skin is going blue.  She snapped out of it after about 30 seconds, but during that time I saw why people used to think epilepsy was caused by possession.  

After that I come back to my room and try to do homework.  However, physics is a bitch, and I can't get her face out of my mind.  It was easily one of the scariest things I have ever seen.  I decide to go on reddit to distract myself.  After a couple hours of wading through delicious blue links, I hear a really loud banging on the door.  The person across the hall was practically falling onto my door.  He had just started to lose hearing and sight, as well as feeling incredibly dizzy.  I walk him downstairs to the RAs, but no one is there.  Then we try to go to the health center, but they are closed as well.  Finally I have to call the campus police to get help.

She had numerous health problems, the primary one being progressive epilepsy. She was in the hospital a month or so ago and we thought we might lose her, but she made a near full recovery and was basically back to normal until I got a call from my grandmother yesterday morning saying she had passed in the night.

I've never really dealt with an unexpected loss like this. I've only lost grandparents when I was a child. I think I'm still in shock and it hasn't fully sunk in. I got the news when I was out with my girlfriend visiting the planetarium. I haven't cried or anything and I can tell she (my gf) thinks it's weird that I haven't shown much emotion regarding the issue. 

I mainly can't stop thinking about the three children she left behind. Their father is abusive and now they're left with no mother. I know I need to step up and be a bigger part of their lives. 

I personally hate sob stories and I'm not looking for sympathy. That's actually an aspect that I'd like advice on. I'm the type of person to bottle things and not mention them to anyone because I hate feeling like people feel sorry for me. I absolutely hate it. I haven't told anyone other than my girlfriend who was there when I got the news. I went to work as usual because I'm in a new city by myself and my girlfriend went back home an hour away this morning so I'd just be sitting at home by myself. I'm going to let my boss know here in a bit, but I just absolutely hate talking about this sort of thing. I'm really hoping they don't all sign a card for me or something like that.. I don't want everyone asking about it.

My family is more dysfunctional than average, always fighting and being dramatic over stupid things, and I know when I go back home for the funeral it's going to be complete chaos with family members who haven't spoken due to drama seeing each other for the first time in years. I'm dreading it.

1522," Boyfriend and I broke up 9 months ago, he contacted me after 2 months of no contact, I told him how humiliated I was at the time, he said he was too, but still wants to be friends. What should I do?","My boyfriend of two years and I broke up 9 months ago. As we were in the same social circle we remained ""friendly"" for a few months until I moved overseas for a year. He messaged me after 2 months of no contact asking how I was, etc.

While our breakup was not ""nasty"", his actions after (picking up girls in front of me, telling friends details of our relationship, etc) hurt me deeply, though at the time I expressed none of it to him…so when he got in contact again I told him just how humiliated I felt at the time, saying I wasn't sure if I could still be his friend after being disrespected and hurt.

He replied that he too was hurt by things I did in the aftermath of our break up. Justified, I'm not gonna lie, but as I see it not in the same vein as what he did.

He was angry for my hypocrisy, but said if I ever felt we could be friends again to ""let him know"" because ""even though I'm angry right now I'd like to believe I still do care"". I never responded.

It's been 9 months since then with no contact and I am soon moving to the same city as him, which I believe he is aware of.

I miss him, I love him as much as I ever did and I want him back.
How should I approach this situation? I was considering a short message, just telling him I've been thinking of him, wanted to see how his life is, etc.

Does anyone have any advice for me? Should I bring up our argument, or pretend like it didn't happen? He was very angry in his last message. Is there any chance he'd still reconsider us together?

He lives alone and doesn't seem to be taking his medication (or doesn't have any to take, or it's ineffective). He's outside all hours of the day and night talking to himself, or yelling at people who aren't there, often very loudly. And with the way our condos are laid out, that means he's right outside my living room window most of the time.  Usually he's angry or upset, sometimes he's happy when he's drunk.  Over the past week he's been getting louder, and is outside more frequently.

I don't know if he has any family ... I've never seen anyone visit him.  He doesn't have a job, so I have no idea where he gets money for cigs and alcohol.

I realize I could probably call the cops, but other people have called in the past and they usually just warn him to quiet down.  Complaints to the condo board are useless, because all they can do is fine him.  Both of these change his behavior in the short term (i.e. a day or two), which I guess is nice for me but ultimately it doesn't help him.

I called 211, but they basically told me I can't do anything because I'm not a relative.  So I'm out of ideas.  Any thoughts?

No matter how ""happy"" I tell myself I am in each relationship, I feel miserable and I want to drive them away. I know that I have ambivalent-avoidant personality traits due to past traumas but as I've developed I've only gotten worse with interpersonal relationships, including romantic. 

I don't believe I'm happy and thus I can't be happy in a relationship, and I understand that. But I'm also supposed to try and be optimistic right? So I try relationships and stick to them for the long-haul and now I've got a guy I'd say marriage is a possibility.

But I think my traits, past and ""commitment-phobeness"" is keeping me from enjoying any part of this process. I've opened up to him and how I'm feeling but some things he says is quite controversial and can send me into a spiral of confusion, hate, sadness, etc.

Is there a better way to,"We have been dating for 8 months. We have a pretty good relationship. No real arguments until now. 
Lets start out by saying im not against pot. I do not know why im having such an issue with this so bare with me kind of long explanation.

My boyfriend, about a month ago crashed my car. He wasnt high, I was with him. So we decided to pay for a new car together and call it ours. I was fine with that. I told him all I care about is him not having weed in the car or drive high. The reason id because the car is under my nsme. He agreed. Everytime he takes the car I remind him not to have weed in the car. Keep in mind, we've had the car less than a week now.

Now he keeps getting mad I keep reminding him. I told him why I keep reminding him . A while ago I asked him not to smoke one day because for 2 whole weeks whenever I saw him, he would be high. He was incredibly high when I saw him. To me that was him choosing weed over me. I had explained to him why I asked him that and explained why I was upset.

Now I do not know if I am being over bearing. But most times I do not see him rejecting a high. Ive had to wait for him for about an hour while he got high with his friends after work even though we can only see eachother after work. He has 2 jobs. I have a fulltime job and go to school. To me thats choosing weed but he doesnt think so. Now he gets mad because according to him im jumping to conclusions because of one mistake.

So I need to know, am I being irrational? Tell me the honest harsh truth.

Looking back up and down the road, the car doesn't exist. All I see is the same empty road and two guys on the other side looking at me strangely for what I had just done.

Here's some background knowledge: my sister, let's call her Susan, works on a farm; her fiance, Nick, is in a small time band. To put it bluntly, they are a pretty poor couple, and they have difficulty keeping up with basic necessities. To make matters worse, financially, they have a baby on the way.

My step-father agreed to cosign a loan for $250,000 to purchase a house. This is not a downpayment, this is for the entire mortgage. From what I understand, my parents will be stuck with the entire mortgage if my sister cannot pay for it (and she won't be able to pay for it).

This was all without my mother's knowledge, and she is losing her mind. She doesn't want to go to the wedding now and she's getting a marriage counselor. She is trying to come up with some other way to work this out, any way she doesn't have to cosign a loan.

My step-father will not back down since Susan claims to have found their ""dream house"" and it is ""perfect for their new family"". The thing is that they can't get a loan to purchase a house because their credit is absolutely horrendous due to their lackluster history as debtors.

I really don't know how to resolve this. My mom and I had a really long conversation about what to do, since if my sister misses the payments we'll be screwed. I'm in school right now, and those payments are enough for my family to pay for.

Ultimately, I just want to be able to support my mom right now since I think my step-father is clearly in the wrong here. What's the best way to go about supporting her in this situation without alienating the whole family?

My mother is just asking about what legal precautions to take right now to protect her assets. She isn't sure if she needs a lawyer, or anything really. She doesn't necessarily want a divorce yet, either.

So i was in 6th grade, about 12 years old, living in Sweden. Our class was going on some kind of sleep over camping trip in the woods. We brought tents and all that shit and my brand new cellphone that i got from my parents, my first one. I got the whole spiel about only calling in emergencies and all that jazz.

So we're out walking in the woods and me and like 3 other guys and 1 teacher wander off from the group and get separated. It's getting darker but we're still trying to locate the main group. The cellphone reception was spotty so the teacher couldn't reach the other teachers on the trip. Me and another guy walk off a little bit onto a little hill and I get one bar! 

I quickly call my parents for some dumb ass reason and say we're lost, but forget to mention the slight detail that we have a teacher with us. With reception being spotty it's hard to communicate and a lot of things got lost. The call gets dropped and I don't think much of it. 

We finally somehow find the main group, i think just by walking around and that's when I get a call from the vice principal of the school. Apperently my parents had called the school and the police. The police we're going to get choppers ready but as it was already dark that wasn't feasible. So they started mounting a search party with dogs and the whole shebang.

This is a generalisation - obviously there are some awesome girls out there. Generally though, those that are awesome tend to be ugly or take poor care of themselves.

Long story short: I broke up with a girl after a relationship of 4-5 years after I found out she was cheating on me. She moved out before the breakup for a job in a different state. So currently I still have some of her crap, and she still has some of mine.

She doesn't have anything of mine that I would consider very important, a few books and a bookcase, some CDs. I have most of her furniture: a couch, love seat, couple of dressers, etc (she moved out with the understanding that we wouldn't be breaking up, btw). 

She's already told me that she doesn't want her things back. That's fine, but I still have a few things of hers which I would feel guilty about keeping or throwing away (things like her old school books, photos, some of her legal documents, etc.).

I'm thinking about renting a trailer to take her crap to her. My theory is that since I broke up with her, I don't want to give her any reason to blame me for being the ""crazy ex"" or whatever in the future, so I want to get everything settled-up and resolved, and move on guilt-free. I don't want to keep her things because they're from my past now, a past I want to forget about. At the same time I don't want to throw them out for the reasons already given.

Is there a better way to handle her,"I believe my ex has BPD. She matched much of the criteria on various sources I researched. She would always lash out but then regret it later. I felt like I was walking on egg shells around her. She always felt like I had abandoned her. One moment everything is fine, next moment she might be packing her bags and leaving my place. 

I was always so afraid to commit myself fully to her because I noticed her BPD tendencies really early on. Obviously, I didn't really know what I was experiencing. I very likely didn't handle things the right way.

There was no telling how unpredictable her reactions would be. She would always feel abandoned by me. Obviously there were lots of different cases of this happening, but there is one that definitely stands out. This one hurt me the most. She had been drinking a lot one night with her friends and I told her I was going to bed. I genuinely just wanted to sleep; it was late. She ofcourse took it the wrong way and got upset, thinking that I was mad at her. She sent me lots of texts immediately expressing anger. 

That night, she cheated on me with a guy she met down town. She told me the next day. Her reasoning was that she felt like she was losing me and that this was the only way she could address her feelings. She said she had been ""falling hard"" for me and didn't know how to control her feelings. I forgave her. I continued to stay with her for another 4 months.

I broke up with her last month. I have been dealing with regret because I essentially quit on her. I feel like I did the best thing for myself and her own growth. However, I still wonder if it could've been handled, if things could improve. Lord knows the good times were great.

Knowing this is making it harder to stay friends, as any kind of interaction makes me sad, despite the fact i feel so happy around her. Even if i did tell her i liked her, and in an ideal world she said yes... it is VERY likely it wouldn't work out in the long run anyways, me being here and her going back home 1000's of miles away 

Therefore what i'm trying to say is, is telling her my true feelings for her a good idea or a bad one? I've tried to keep my distance the past few days to think through my feeling, which only confuses her more i imagine as we talked almost constantly. She's really enjoyed herself in this country so far and just adding more stress is definitively something i don't wish to do, even if i get the vibe that she may like me back.

He has a budding company which I helped support parts financially through use of my credit and there are some that are just from 'wanting' misc items. All those 0%APRs that coaxed me in finally expired so I've got debt with 18-20% steadily building up. Needless to say we were living beyond our means and now I'm fucked.  (Not including my ridiculous amount owed for college).  I have never been late on payments and I've had some pretty good credit up til now. Considering refinancing through my bank and hopefully paying these off and getting my beacon score back to normal. I would like to buy a house one day but with how all of this is going it's beginning to look like that may never happen.

1542, I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years and now I'm not sure if I made a mistake. I'm not sure if I can handle the pressure of having a live in boyfriend who has nowhere else to live when he gets out of prison.,"He is currently at RIDOC (please don't judge) but I did not meet him there. There was so much familiarity in all of this and comfort. His mom died not too long ago so he really has nowhere to live when he gets out. Most of all our dating and romance has in fact been done throughout his prison sentence(s) (he got out and then quickly went back in bc his mom died and he was drinking a lot etc).

In some ways my life has gotten better. I went back to work. I'm so afraid of so many things though. I don't really have the energy for a live in boyfriend especially knowing or always thinking he is there bc he has nowhere else. He has assured me he is not many times but I'm not comfortable with all this pressure. I keep thinking maybe he can do better and I don't want to wait until that happens. I'm tired of feeling lousy about myself. He has some narcissistic tendencies. Even his mom said sometimes he can be so sweet and other times he can be the devil. So it's a lot to deal with. 

I couldn't really function that well at work on Saturday. I was so stressed out about going through this break up that I keep prolonging it. I don't know how to get out. I've broken up with him before only to miss him terribly and then chase him again. In fact I can take accountability that I chased him from the beginning. I'm very attracted to him and he is a mechanic too. That's how we met I put an ad on craigslist bc my heater core in my cadillac was broken.

What should I do? Is there any way to ease into it so that it's not so overwhelming? Should I give it a chance? I know no one can really tell me what to do but I can't keep posting on PTO either and I could use some advice.

1544," I have to go out of town for work, girlfriend and I both know we won't work out in the long run, but we both really want to keep each other company while I'm away. Any tips on how to deal with the situation or","My girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 months, yet we have known each other for months before that. We live in the same city now but in the next couple weeks I will have to go out of town for work (~7 hours away).

Here is the dilemma: The long distance is not an issue, but the real issue is that we both know that our relationship will not work out in the long run due to family compatibility issues (culture, etc). Family is very important for the both of us, so we understand that in the long run if our families aren't happy then things will be very difficult in the future.

So right now we are in a depressing gut wrenching stage where we both know I am leaving in a couple weeks, and we aren't sure what is happening after that between us. And the closer and closer this date gets the more we naturally tightly hold on to each other. It's seriously depressing. We both are kind of aware that it has to come, we would love to remain friends but obviously it's really hard to remain friends in a situation like this.

For me, I know I can deal with things over time, but what kills me is I know she'll be devastated by this. It really tears at you seeing an extremely gentle caring person potentially get hurt. Especially when she's so understanding and willing to take the hit. We have both told each other we'd just enjoy each others company and after I leave for work we'd figure it out. However obviously its still very hard. Part of me wants to say fuck the parents, lets do this. But realistically its not that easy :(

Any advice in this situation? Is there something I can say/we can both do to make this easier? Anyone had any experience with a situation like this? This thing has honestly been eating away at me. Thanks in advance.

1545," I met a girl, we kissed once, then she dropped off the radar, came back, kissed again, dropped off again, came back again, and so on. She has a girlfriend, but keeps telling me she likes me. What the fuck","Hi Reddit

For the last six months, I've had a small crush on this girl. Nothing major, I just think she's cute. We've never spoken in depth about anything, just random stuff once or twice a month for this period.

About a month after I met her, I slept (literally slept) with her - we cuddled a bit, but that's it. I texted her twice, but she was always slow to reply, so I figured that was it.

We then spoke on and off for some time.

About a month ago, she kissed me early in the evening at a party, and then hung on me for the rest of the evening. No more than one kiss, and I was sort of annoyed that she was toying with me. I texted her the following days where she was all smiles, until she suddenly dropped off the radar and didn't respond to anything for some days. I stopped too, figured she'd come around if she wanted to. I thought that was the end of it, as contact was kept pretty short after this.

Come last night. I figured she was done, but no, she texted me all night and we end up kissing again. She had a girlfriend staying from out of town, so she went home with her. Then here I am today. She snapped me a couple of times, but I really can't be arsed dealing with this hot and cold behaviour. How do I figure out what the fuck she wants? Every time I asked her she tells me she likes me, but then keeps pulling this shit.

I feel like saying fuck it, but she's so nice and sweet, and really pretty too. Dropping off the radar just isn't cool.

1546, Ex broke up with me because of her feelings for another guy. We met again and now she's admitted to having feelings for him. I feel like shit and don't know how to deal with it.,"So a month ago my ex broke up with me after 5 months of the relationship saying that she was having some trouble coping emotionally with her past (specifically ex bf). I tried convincing her to stay with me so we can try and deal with it together.

I have her time, limited contact, never got angry for it and generally tried to be understanding. After all, we never argued, always had fun, had amazing sex and even said we love each other. 

Recently we meet again and I tried getting back together. After a while of giving me very unconvincing arguments she admitted she has feelings from somebody else. I immediately guessed it was her work mate as they both had feelings for each other before, but never went out on a date. 

She claims that it only started a few weeks ago which is hard to believe given that they sit next to each other in the office (and even so that's still quite soon after the break up when she claimed she needed time alone). I no longer believe the reason she gave me for the break up and most likely he was the reason. After all, during the break up she was insisting I should find somebody else as I deserve better and that I shouldn't wait for her to sort her feelings out. 

I now feel like shit as I believed her to be honest with me and now I have to question all of that. I really don't know what I can do to make myself get over it. Unfortunately, we're in the same friendship group which means I'll be seeing her a lot. 

At least I asked out a girl I met after the break up so I have date coming up to take my mind off of her, but that's not enough it seems. 

If you have a similar story, please share. I'd like to know how to deal with this.

We basically entertained the idea of her making out with a girl (mutually), To discussing well we can't just bring a girl over and have her leave for us to have sex to, let me ask this girl if she wants to. 

The girl that she asked initially said yes but now the next day is having doubts but hasn't said no. The girl in question is a good friend of hers so I'm assuming it's somebody she's comfortable with.

Now I've never done this before so I have no idea where to start. But how do I approach the situation and let her know about somebody I might have in mind. I would want this someone to focus on her mainly so she doesn't think that I just want to have sex with other woman. 

I told her from the start if she is any way uncomfortable with this then we don't have to go through with it because I cherish our relationship more than a threesome.

1549, Wife has a friend that steals from us and my wife doesn't get rid of her because she has no other close friends in our town and her closest family is 5 hours away.  Wife doesn't get rid of her but ……,"So my wife has a friend that I will call Julie.  My wife and Julie have been friends for about 6 years if I remember correctly.  Julie is a shit friend in my opinion and I have told the wife my feelings.  When they lived together Julie would start physical fights with my wife and spat on my wife's face once.  Now when Julie comes over to our house there is a 98% chance that something will be broken and really really dirty when she leaves.
Julie does not have any other good close friends in our town and her closest family is 5 hours away.  I am thinking that is why my wife doesn't get rid of Julie.  About 7 months ago we were all outside and Julie said that she needed to go inside to use the restroom.  As we soon outside I noticed that our bedroom light turned on, stayed on for less than a minute, and then went off.  
Later that night after Julie left when the wife and I went inside and the wife discovered that her purse had been moved and that she was missing $20.  I looked at my stuff and my checkbook had been moved.  The only other person in our house that night was Julie and she was left alone.
On Saturday my wife went shopping with Julie.  Again for some reason my wife left her purse with Julie alone.  Today my wife was trying to buy gas and is now missing $30.  
Before Julie started to steal from us her car battery died and she called us.  Stupidly I paid for and installed a new one for her.  I still haven't been paid back for that $87.
I am trying to figure out if it is time for me to say something to Julie or do I let the wife handle it?

Because engagement and marriage isn't on the cards yet I was just wondering how could I possibly get them at something all together. I would just love them to all meet. My boyfriend is graduating from college in November but, my brother won't be around for that. 

I would just love to arrange something to have everyone together and meet everyone. It is important to me. Our apartment is too small to host anything and my boyfriends mother is on her own so I wouldn't like it to just be my parents and her.

We get along great. My family, however, after first meeting her, is concerned about the psychological effects of dating someone that looks exactly like my sister.

Is it normal for him to do this, and is it","We're both University students, and he had coordinated a fantastic cultural show this year at the beginning of February.  He also designed shirts for all the people who helped out, and the shirt also looked great.  He did an incredible job at planning the show and making the shirts, and I am super proud of him.  However, its been almost 3 months now, and he still brings it up at least once a day on how awesome his show was.  He'll even interrupt people when the conversation topic is remotely related to talk about how great his show was.  I would compliment and praise him on his performance every time, but lately, I've started to get really irritated with him and I would think to myself, ""does he really need to bring the attention back to him, even though the conversation is barely related?""  

Earlier, I spoke to him about it and said that he should stop bringing up the show and shirts so much.  Him constantly bringing it up is getting irritating.  But immediately he got angry and upset with me, saying that he lets me talk about things that make me happy, why can't I let him talk about the things that make him happy.  I think he took it at a personal attack or that I'm not proud of him, but I really am, both the show and tshirts were great.

I don't know if I should have brought it up or just continued to let him.  I had planned the same show the year before, so maybe I was just resenting out of jealousy.  But he also does the same thing about his new job.  He currently works at a large software company while also attending school, and whenever anyone brings up the topic of job, he has to tell everyone that he works at this said software company. 

I'm wondering if his actions are normal and that I'm in the wrong for calling him out, or if it's not and he's trying too hard to boast or fish for compliments.

TL;DR: I got caught with alcohol on me","This happened last night/early hours of this morning, so it's pretty fresh in my mind. For added background I'm a 16 year old guy living in Scotland.

Last night myself and a few friends were invited to a house party, which was good fun. Being the 16 year olds that we are we really don't care what we drink, as long as it gets us drunk, so 3 bottles of buckfast later and a coke, rum, vodka, tequila mix between the 4 of us (there was about 100 people at this party, we don't share or hand out drinks lol sorry) we were all a mess.

By the end of the night we were pretty intoxicated, and we were about to head to another party, but we were all to drunk to move. We waited a outside for a while where the first party was being held and, because when we are drunk we smoke, I decided to start rolling a cigarette. Next thing I know there are headlights are in my face. It was the police. 

We were all drunk and still had bottles of beer on us, so we began to run. I threw my cigarette back in it's rolling pouch and began to run as fast as I could. Imagine what it looks like to a police officer when a teenager is rolling something then begins to run when they show up? 

I feel the strongest takedown of my life. This guy was superhuman. All my friends kept on running, every man for themselves, bolting away in every direction. I get dragged to my feet and they ask me what I was rolling. At this point I was thinking the whole ""don't say weed... don't say weed"" to myself, but sure enough the drunk mess I am comes out with ""weed... I... I mean... It was a cigarette"". They searched my bag and took all my alcohol, which is fair enough, but they searched me for about 10-15 minutes looking for this weed that I didn't have. It was humiliating. They found where I kept my tobacco and looked through that before handing it back feeling satisfied that I wasn't carrying any drugs.

They took all my details and because my Dad was also in the police (sorry Dad) they let me walk home and brushed it all under the rug.

She texted me and talked to me about it until she finally got over it. 

A couple weeks pass by and Jenny starts getting closer to me in class, we have class with each other every day. We start sitting next to each other, yeah no big deal.

We're sitting on a bench with a couple other mutual friends and she rests her head on my shoulder.

Should I tell her how I feel or keep my mouth shut and be a loyal friend?,"For the sake of this post, lets call my(m) friend Elise(f). I have known her for six years now. We first met in the sixth grade but really formed our relationship two years later in the eighth grade. We are both currently seniors at the same high school, but we do not see each other very often as I have opted to enter a program letting me attend college earlier.

I first started liking her romantically in eighth grade but was never confident enough to act on those feelings because I was afraid of ruining my relationship with her. I have never been good at establishing solid relationships and have very large trust issues. I became extremely depressed in my freshmen and sophomore years of high school and lost many of my friends, including Elise. After hitting an extreme low I started reconnecting with a small number of friends. 

This is when I discovered that Elise had gotten a boyfriend. My attraction with her has always remained present but it has become more painful for me now that she has an SO (lets call him Simon). She has a somewhat shaky relationship with Simon from what she has told me but they have remained together for the past two years. Recently she has become sexually active in the relationship and almost always lets me know of a new development within 2-3 days of it happening. She very recently had sex with Simon for the first time and it was caused me to finally look into posting something here. 

It is her first romantic relationship and Simon has expressed no desire in remaining with her while she moves away to college. Regardless she wants to stay with him until he breaks up with her.

I do not know if I should confess my feelings for her and let her know that I have a more romantic inclination towards her or if I should just stay quiet and remain a loyal friend. I do not believe our relationship would be extremely damaged by my revelation but I also do not know if I should take the risk.

They live together and he has told me that he wants to marry her.

But my brother was kind of slutty when we were in school, so the idea of settling down terrifies him a little. His girlfriend is very lovely and not rushing him at all, and he is genuinely in love with her. 

But two weeks ago, he made some comment about not wanting to have kids (which was a lie because he has wanted kids since we were in high school). He was just freaking out about being domestic or whatever. His girlfriend probably knew he was lying but the argument snowballed and she decided that she was done with his commitment-phobic shit. So she kicked him out and he has been sleeping on our couch for a week now.

His place with his girlfriend is under both their names, so it doesn't make financial sense for him to just drop hundreds of dollars on a new apartment when he's still technically paying rent. If they decide to break up for good, they'll both have to move out because neither of them can afford their apartment on their own.

He's being ridiculously moopy, whining about how much he loves/misses her, and generally annoying the shit out of me. I understand that it might be the end of a 2-year relationship but the whole thing was his fault and if he wants to get back with her he needs to go talk to her and sort his shit out. Honestly I think his girlfriend intended this to be a reality check and a wake-up call rather than a breakup. 

I would love to kick him in the ass and tell him to make up his mind and grow the hell up, but my boyfriend has been bonding with my brother and says that we need to give him more time.

Also, there was immense pressure to donate because you were surrounded by lots of others,  everyone waiting for your response made it even more awkward, you would seem unreasonable if you didn't donate, and the power was in there hands, because they still had your money.

Just to eliminate confusion: I am all for donation, but I just felt that the way that they did it was unfair.

Now to go on: The first time that I was asked was at one of the booths.  I was not sure whether I would have enough money for food, so I declined to donate.  After mentioning this, the clerk handed me my receipt, and asked me to sign some paper to donate.  I asked him what it was, and then explained to him that I would still like to have my change back (he had not given me it).  I am not sure if it was on accident or not, but he seemed to give me a hard time, and seemed to take a while opening the register to give me my change back.  Then (I am not sure if this was on accident or not), he gave me my lift sticker, but did not give me the metal thing on which to attach it, which I noticed after I had left the booth.

Another time, I was at a cash register, and the person that I was with declined to donate.  The person at the cash register said, ""But it is only one dollar,"" and ""That little boy over there donated.""  My friend responded with, ""No Thanks,"" and the person responded, ""Yes?""  I just thought that the whole process was quite annoying.

Am I overreacting?  Is it OK the way that they handled the donation process?

We went out for coffee and had a really nice conversation for about two hours. We texted a lot over the next few days and things seemed to be going pretty well.
  
We had our second date last night. We went out for dinner and  drinks and the conversation was flowing pretty smoothly. I suggested that we move on to another bar. She suggested we go back to her place and drink.
  
We ended up making out on her couch and things moved to the bedroom and we had sex. Not long after we were done, she asked me to leave. She had work in the morning and I didn't, so I didn't think much of it because she needed to sleep.
  
This afternoon I got the text saying she wasn't interested in pursuing things any further. Did I do something wrong? She seemed to enjoy the sex very much, so I don't think it was that. I feel so used and could use some kind words.

1561," Bf's ex-wife is contacting him after a year of no contact, demanding to meet up and talk, but he doesn't feel comfortable doing so, and is confused as to why she is contacting him again after the divorce was finalized.","My bf was married for 24 years and got divorced a little over a year ago. One night, in a fit of moral-cleansing, he confessed to his ex-wife that he had had an affair with a co-worker the last two years they were married. She replied with a scathing email (understandably) a few days later, and my bf decided not to respond and leave it at that. 

It's been about a month since her email, and now in the last few days, she has been texting/emailing/calling him, saying things like ""I think it's time we talk. You can come here, or I can come there. Which do you prefer?"" He hasn't responded because he doesn't feel comfortable meeting her face to face and thinks it's somewhat out of character for her, as he says that she was the one who refused to communicate with him during and after their divorce. 

She moved away during the divorce proceedings and does not live in the state. The last text he got from her today read ""I haven't heard from you. I will see you at house.""

I'm a little scared as I live with him and don't know what she wants to accomplish? She came over unannounced once before and tried to come in through the back door, but he caught her and stopped her before she could come in. She proceeded to scream at him, demanding to know who was in the house, and that I leave, etc. He says this scared and confused him as she had never done anything like that before nor indicated she had a problem with him dating, etc.

What can I do to feel better and move on","I'll try to keep this short. I was together with her for 6 years. It was a really shitty 6 years for me. She has A LOT of psychological issues. Was unemployed, can't show love, hates to cuddle... this list goes on. Basically, I gave her everything and she improved a lot, now she is in therapy, has a job and doesn't completely freak out when someone touches her. I feel we made real progress and we both grew as humans through this relationship.
However, I am moving for a job out of the country. and I know this relationship will not work out being so far apart. She is not that far to keep a relationship healthy on that distance. i don't hold it against her, I really do not. Also I tend to get really really jealous (ramains as my previous guy cheated on me and she did in the first year but never since, I am not proud of it). I am just convinced that it will not work out and when I spoke to her, she agreed. So we broke off and decided to stay good friends, since I am also her main source of trust. Now we have this awkward relationship where we discuss really really intimate things and I know she feels terrible although she plays fine (I learned to read her subtext). And I feel horrible like I left her alone and I also still love her. To make everything worse a good friend is hitting on me and thinks now is his chance. I'm sexually frustrated because I have not had sex in years (due to her condition) but I am still emotionally attached to my last SO. On top of moving, getting to the new job, finishing my degree and stuff, I kind of lost track on everything. Help?

Without thinking too much, I go out and hold down the lever and pull the cord.  The engine starts for 2 seconds and starts and then dies down and kills itself.  I realize that there's another tank separately for gas and oil (was not aware of this...).  I read Google and people tell me to pour the entire mixture out of the oil tank.

I did so and all of it was poured out.  I leave the valve open and let it dry for 36 hours.  I come back and pour in a new oil.  I slowly pulled the cord to ""let some oil into the engine to hopefully clean out the bad mixture that might have gotten in.""  Then I pour out that old mixture and pour in new oil again for ""clean"" oil.  I go and try to start the lawnmower and it isn't starting properly.

We were fighting a lot because I wasn't allowed to sleep over his place and he said that it wasn't normal. A week before we broke up he told me he was planning on seeing this other girl that he knew had liked him for a while. I got very upset and he said he wouldn't go ahead with it. Eventually we decided to break up and wait for the right time we could properly be together with no restrictions. We did promise each other we wouldn't see other people during this time. During this break we were still constantly seeing and sleeping with each other until one day I saw a photo of him on Facebook holding hands with another girl. At this point, I recognised he had moved on and let it go. After a few weeks, we started talking again and decided to get back together. I asked him if he slept with that girl he was seeing and he said no, however, I didn't believe him and constantly asked him about it but he kept denying it. Last week, I came home and found he had left his Facebook open, I knew it was wrong to snoop but I just had a feeling he was lying so I read his messages. I found out he did sleep with this girl, he also took mdma with her and boasted to his friend about how awesome the sex was.

1566," I feel uncomfortable about my girlfriend's male best friend, who has feelings for her, living literally next door to her apartment next semester, but my girlfriend doesn't see a problem with it, and I don't know if I have a reason to feel","I have been dating my girlfriend Sarah for almost a year. She has a male best friend, John, with whom she is very close, but it hasn't proved to be a problem in our relationship, so I was pretty ok with it. I don't hang out with any other girls one on one, but that's just because I'm in a major with very few females, so most of my friends are guys.
  
Every time I've met John, he's seemed friendly, but he is always somewhat short with me. He constantly texts and snapchats Sarah, except when he knows she and I are together, in which case he just stops. He also doesn't seem to like being around us when we're together, because he is awkward and looks somewhat uncomfortable. In the past when we've all gone out together he has tried to subtly assert just how well he knows Sarah in a way that seems competitive/confrontational. 

 John has been on and off with one of his previous girlfriends since the time I started dating Sarah, but he can't seem to make anything stick. Sarah says it's because he just can't get over his ex, but I suspect that he might not be able to commit to anyone else because he has feelings for Sarah.

Now the kicker is that next semester Sarah is planning on getting a single person apartment that is literally directly beside John's apartment, which she is excited about because they're good friends. This makes me uncomfortable, but not because I don't trust my girlfriend. I totally trust Sarah, and she is by no means a flirty or overly sexual person anyway. It's John that I dont really trust, and I think that for whatever reason she can't see or accept that he might have feelings for her. 

My girlfriend doesn't know that I feel this way about John, because I know that she firmly believes that they have a platonic relationship (she may be right), and I think she might accuse me of being jealous or possessive if i tell her. 

Is it wrong for me to be feeling uncomfortable about this? Am I being jealous/possessive/controlling, or do I have any legitimate reason for concern?

She checks out my main Reddit account constantly, then sends me shitty things about stuff I've posted or responded to.

My hope is that she'll eventually leave me alone, but I'm a fucking idiot and would drag my wang through broken glass to sleep with her one more time, and have.  Can the pussy be that good, you ask?  Fuck me, it really is.  I can glorify it now that she'll not know this account, but holy shit, she's a sexual volcano.  I wouldn't consider myself a novice or even intermediate status, so I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about (ha, hubris).  

She's sabotaged two potential relationships with her fanatical tirades.  Is an unabashed liar, cheater, emotional manipulator, etc. etc.  Again.  I am an idiot, I know.  Aside from getting a restraining order, which I don't really have the time to spend in court, what can I do to rid myself of this succubus?

I have much more fulfilling conversations with my friends, roommate, etc. When I try to talk to Tom about my day it just feels empty. He never really has anything to say back and I find myself struggling to edit down what I'm saying. Man this is hard to describe. He sort of just jumps to the end of the conversation and says things like ""oh well I'm sure you'll figure it out"" or ""just try to deal with it"" or ""well you're home now so..."" just sort of stuff that kills any progress of conversation.

1569," I told my new boyfriend that I love him in my sleep, but I don't remember it. Is there any reason to worry about it, or is it just a case of ""I love you, but not in the way (yet)?""","Hello all! 

The background:

I (22f) have been dating a special someone (20m) for about a month now. Everything is going really well and we make each other very happy-- of course, we're probably still in the honeymoon phase! We haven't spent a night apart since we started dating and one could argue that we spend too much time together (a question for another time!) We've could be moving too fast, but everything feels good and natural so we're throwing caution to the wind and just going with it. 

The situation:

I tend to talk a lot in my sleep and as I hover on the half-asleep edge of consciousness. Apparently for the last week I've been telling him that I love him, which I don't remember doing. I doubt this is a reflex or instinctual thing from previous relationships since I call him out by name and I haven't said (or even wanted to say) ""I love you"" to anyone in years, and I've been in other relationships since then. This is also the first time I've ever said it in my [half-]sleep, to my knowledge.

I've heard somewhere that the subconscious doesn't tell lies, so is this a case of ""I love him but I don't know it?"" Personally I find the notion a little silly, but I wont rule it out. I definitely like him a lot, but being in love after four weeks? That's silly too.

I wonder if they wonder what the future between you two will be like. I wonder if they wonder about a future with another person at all. Do they worry like women do? Do they wonder if they will ever be alone when they're older? Maybe they're just always confident that they will eventually meet someone even if they're older. Men are lucky in that way. They age like fine wine. Women on the other hand seem to expire after a certain age. Women become unwanted after wrinkles creep in, bags under the eyes start to form, your youth fading away.... Maybe this is why women worry so much more about finding someone to spend our life with. Because women want to make sure they have someone that will love them even after time starts to take a toll on their looks. Is this why women have always been expected to marry young? Because of this ultimate truth in the world? Now it's even harder to keep up with looking 'good' because of all the false advertising of how women's bodies should be. There is always the argument brought up that 'looks don't really matter'. Lies. Looks do matter because that's the first thing that attracts you to a person. That attraction is needed on a physical level, to a certain extent, in a relationship. After that you may look for a certain kind of emotional connection with the person. Then start finding out different interests you share, and some you can learn from one another. Also, religion comes into play. Sometimes that can be a deal breaker in a relationship. With so many factors coming into play, how do you find someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?

TL;DR: I let my student loans get 3 months past","I'm not sure where to turn for advice on something such as this, so I come to you reddit!

I went to college for two years fresh out of high school. I took out some student loans through Sallie Mae. I ultimately ended up dropping out and working for a couple of years. I went back to school and took out more student loans through Fed Loan Servicing. None of these are ""private"" student loans. I ultimately owe somewhere in the neighborhood of $20,000 in student loan debt between Sallie mae and Fed Loan Servicing.

None of that's really a big deal. I didn't end up completing my degree but I'm in a field where it's not really an issue anymore. I'm making great money without it.

Now for the problem; After my last quarter in college (before dropping out again), my deferment period ended (6 months after dropping out of course). At the time, I was going through a rough patch financially and mentally. I ended up letting my student loans get about 3 months past due. Once I realized how late they were, I immediately called them and told them about my situation. They allowed me to go on a forbearance period until I got things straight. I didn't know it at the time, but they had reported these late payments to the credit agencies (since they weren't consolidated, 7 late payments were reported). I just called Sallie Mae and they said that there is nothing that they can do to remove this from my credit even if I were to pay it off in full right now. They said it will take 7-10 years for it to automatically fall off.

Needless to say, this has completely wrecked my credit. Is there anything that I can do about this? I'm in good standing with them now and looking to pay these off completely in the next couple of years. I also have a couple of credit cards, a car loan, and have lived in several apartments (all of which have never been more than a little late rarely). I know that this is entirely my fault.

Today, I got $2500 in the mail. According to the link above, I got the expected amount. On the other hand, one of my fellow interns got the ""economic need"" max amound. $4000. He told me that he does not qualify for economic need. No one filled out any paperwork or answered any questions pertaining to their economic status. What happened? How does the univeristy or the grant applicant even determine our economic standing without asking us?

We are worried that one of the 10 interns who actually qualifies for the $4000 did not receive his or her proper amount. Is this even possible? the check was addressed to each of our names and addresses from the hosting university.

Furthermore, the pdf about the grant states that each intern should be paid in 2 installments. I got a single check. I'm guessing that means the 2 installments deal is a guideline?

1579," I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years because of communication issues and his inability to communicate emotions and feelings. He now wants to go to counseling and do whatever it takes to keep me with him, but I feel like I made a huge mistake.","So me and my now ex met online July 2013. From the start I knew he was a really disciplined individual because of his eating habits ( very strict; non GMO, only free range meats etc..), his education and his martial arts career. 

Things were great up until 4 months ago, we would argue all the time about everything. We would have super intense arguments over the stupidest things like me wearing make up (he thought I looked hideous and super fake) or like me talking about something stressful in my life without warning him first that I was going to do that. He restricted my ability to talk about my stress in life to the weekends because he ""couldn't handle my emotions all the time"" and when it came down to discussing my stress or an argument, he would dissect every emotion to action to reaction to emotion. I just couldn't do that anymore, even after letting him know all I wanted him to do is just to listen, not to analyze in explicit detail everything I was feeling and my actions because of those feelings. 

I even went to counseling for the last 3 weeks because he said my communication is poor and I don't understand the English Language ( even though it is my first language). I was just going to counseling by myself. He never offered to come along with me. 

So I broke up with him yesterday, and it wasn't until I said "" I realized through the counseling that I am just done trying to make us work"" was he then willing to commit and go to counseling and ""Do whatever it takes to keep you here with me"" I didn't give in to that because I feel like if he really did want to make us work, he would have been that committed since the beginning of our problems. 

But now I feel really guilty. I feel like I should have given him that opportunity. I don't know if it's just a post break up feeling or if I genuinely made a huge mistake.

1580," I met a girl in class, we talked a bit, asked her out, she said she would've liked to go with me, but had other plans, but didn't give a number. What to do next.......","So before I go into details, let me paint the picture. I started the spring semester without any intention of looking for an SO, but the moment this girl walked into my class and sat next to me, I couldn't help but think she was attractive as hell(I'll go ahead and call her E). It was the first day of class, so the professor is explaining the syllabus and other crap, and as the professor continues, out of the corner of my eye I find E just completely looking at me and smile at one of my remarks. I make an effort to turn and talk to her but she quickly avoids eye contact and looks at her phone.

Fast forward to February and I decide to strike a conversation, so I decide to ask her about her running apparel, and we end up talking for bit before she says she has to go for track practice. We shake hands, exchange names and smiles and part ways. Over the next 4 weeks I don't see E because of what I think is a busy track schedule. Then this past week, on Wednesday she actually showed up to class, and I made conversation after class again. We start talking about how her recent out of state competition was, and our majors, and just exchanging laughs as I walked her to her dorm. When we arrived at her dorm, E initiated a hug and thanked me for walking with her to her dorm. As E was walking away, I decided to call out her name, and she turned around with an obvious smirk on her face, and I asked if she wanted to go to concert with me, because I had an extra ticket. E said that she would've liked to go with me, but that she already had plans for that day. We smile and go our separate ways again, only to remember that I forgot to ask for a number. I decided to go for it yesterday, but unsurprisingly, she didn't show up for class.

I feel like I'm getting signals of interest from her, but I can't help but think that she is merely being polite. I also think I have a really small sample size of our one to one conversations, to act accordingly. Anybody got some input for a fellow single college student?

TL;DR: I met a girl, wanted to ask her","This actually happened approximately 5-6 months ago. I'm in high school right now. So I met this girl in my class, let's just call her Rachel. Rachel was a really interesting person to talk to, and I realized that I had almost all my classes with her. So we talked almost all day, she gave me her number, then school was over, and everyone went home. At home I was texting her, we were conversing, and I started to think about how attractive Rachel was. Then while I was on the bus to school I decided in my head that I was going to ask Rachel out. I planned it out in a way, and was pretty nervous. So when we arrive at school I go to class and I see her in class and we talked and hung out etc. Then as we left the class, I was going to just grow some balls, man up, and ask her out. So I said ""Rachel,"" as she was talking to one of her friends. She turned around, and I felt a sneeze coming on. I instantly knew that this was going to be *bad.* When she turned around with her mouth still open from laughing, I unleashed. I sneezed one of the biggest and most snot filled sneezes you've ever seen. And I sneezed *directly* on her face and in her mouth.

This whole story starts last summer, when I had my car at the mechanic for the mandatory biannual check up that we have here in Norway. I have a 29y old car that went out of production in 1990, so almost no pro garage has any real knowlesge about my car. My car passed the inspection with flying colors, so I presumed everything was fine.

Here the real fuck up begins, because apparently the garage forgot to submit the results, so in the police' database, my car was now listed as not road legal, and should have its licence plates removed.

Come today I've been at a cabin with some friends, and it was time to go home, so I loaded up my stuff and drove to town to fuel up before I were to start my 3 hour drive back home. A police cruiser was parked at that very gas station and were routinely running plates when mine came up as not road legal.

Duitily the police officer walked up to me and told me what was up, and that he had to take my plates. So I just had to drive my car to the station, take off the plates, and now I'm stranded here. Cool. The next train leaves for home in 2 hours...

A few short details: I'm using a throwaway in case he browses reddit. We've been together about a year and a half. If you're wondering about the age difference, I've always been attracted to older men and I've had people constantly telling me I'm ""mature for my age"" for as far back as I can remember.  He has been trying to get his job to transfer him to my state (I live in Washington, he in Oregon) even before he met me. His company strung him along for a year or more and even paid to fly him to WA and interview him and months later, they finally just told him that it wouldn't happen ever, he felt quite crushed when told. There is also some family drama going on that is hurting him quite a bit and normal life annoyances like car trouble and he has just generally been feeling down when he is usually very up-beat. 

I want to help and support him without bruising his ego and I know this is a challenging problem given our distance. I've been trying to support him without babying him (I feel that wouldn't help the situation) but I'm just worried he's not getting better.

We end up seeing each other once a week because we live an hour away and my schedule has been crap for so long. Between grand school and working 2nd shift every weekend, one day week is what we usually average out to.

He has his own house, a good job, and would love for me to live with him. My job doesn't pay all that much, but it does allow me some financial independence. I've been living with my parents for the past couple of years because my internship schedule+school schedule has made it very difficult to hold down full time work (plus, I saved like 20k by doing it).

All signs point to moving in with him, but I'm worried that it might take me awhile to find work. My biggest concern would be if in 4-5 months from now,  I don't have a job and my student loans start coming in. I have some money saved away, so I could probably pay for 3-4 months of payments. I've been applying to a bunch of jobs in the area, but no nibbles yet.

I imagine them on the other side of the screen having a moment of ""Nope. Sorry. You are an extremely creepy person. I want you out of my life. Don't ever contact me again."" It tends to happen after we have some sort of interaction, usually one that seemed to end on a positive note (in other words, they didn't seem at all angry or uncomfortable, but I'm assuming they were).

Is that usually how it is for you?

Military action in Syria on shaky-at-best grounds is the last straw for me.

I want to stop paying taxes. But given my small income, this would ultimately be a ceremonial gesture that gets me fined or jailed to no avail. My question is, is there a critical mass of citizens whose refusal to pay tax would result in an inability of the government to effectively prosecute for and/or seize the withheld tax, and would this be an effective form of protest? Does such action have historical precedent?

I should point out that I am not opposed to tax. Were I to participate in such a coordinated protest, I would (and would advocate to others) give what money I would have paid in tax directly to public services, to fund education, infrastructure, healthcare, etc. and would inform the IRS I had done so.

I am open to being told I am naive and uninformed, but I want to be explained why. If ""the government has always been this ___"", I think this is deadly apathy we need to do something, and I will gladly ""march around your City Hall"" and ""write to your representative"" but let's not pretend that will get us out of another unwinnable, uninformed, unaffordable war.

1598," I feel insecure about my ability to satisfy a girl who is very good at sex, even though it's in the past. What can I do to feel better about myself and not feel so insecure about it in the future?","A girl and I have recently started dating. Long story short, she was talking about her past sexual experiences and said that her old FWB (male) (also her best friend currently) is very good at sex.

I told her that makes me a bit jealous, and she promptly said that I'm good at fingering, etc. and that I'm a very affectionate, etc. To me, they are just compliments to shut me up even though I'm sure she was being sincere. 

I don't think I'm jealous because of the fact that a guy has had sex with her or whatever, because that's all in the past. I think I'm just insecure knowing that I'm possibly not her best sex partner, which is the dumbest thing ever but I can't help it.

Should I just get over it? Or is there something I should do?

I am going to try to not think about it too much. However, there is a very good chance I will meet her best friend. I feel like I would feel really insecure/self-conscious in front of him. What can I do to help ease that feeling?

1599, I want to be with an asexual woman but she doesn't have a sexual desire and I don't know how to deal with it or if it can be fixed. Any information or advice would be very helpful.,"our relationship is really great and healthy in every other way but as we get to know each other better I have come to understand that she has no real sex drive. She thinks she may be asexual. I think maybe she has a hormonal imbalance or her birth control is doing something but she says it has been this way pretty much her whole adult life.

She almost never denies me sex when I initiate and she has orgasms that she insists are real and she even says that sex feels good with me but that it is mostly because it brings her closer to me. She says that she has never dated anyone for sex and is 100% interested in personality and sexual desire doesn't factor into her interest in me or anyone else. 

This is making it very hard for me to be comfortable initiating sex (she has never once initiated) because I want her to desire me. I want to be loved but I also want to be wanted on a carnal level. Who wouldn't?

I feel like this is either something that can be fixed in her (or does it even need to be fixed?) or it is something that I have to learn to deal with if I want to be with her. I don't want to break up because in every other way she is the most amazing woman I've ever met and I still think I am impossibly lucky. But I just don't know how to be ok with this or what to do about it. 

She keeps telling me not to think about it and that as long as she isn't too tired she will pretty much always have sex with me whenever I want it but she doesnt understand what sexual attraction really means and why it is so important that I be sexually desired by the person I'm having sex with. 

Does anyone out there know anything about asexuality? Are there any no -asexual who have been with or are currently with an asexual person? Any advise or information would be very helpful.

1600, I met a girl after living abroad and we both moved back to the US. She began to flirt with my friend and ended up having sex with him. She then took off to Vegas with him the same night. Should I reply to her or not,"Going to give a quick brief about her: After living abroad for a few years with her husband, she returns home while he gets sent off to be stationed out of the country. I've known her since middle school and we've been good friends. After college, we lost contact during college but then got reacquainted and started talking again a bit more this year.

At one point she began talking about her relationship with her husband and that it was ""getting rocky"". I began to develop some feelings for her but I never acted upon it; I realized that having these kinds of thoughts/feelings would just lead to something worse so I took precaution when I was around her.

However just recently, she did something that took me by surprise. 

My friend and I moved in together and we invited our friends over. I decided to invite her as well; I figured maybe this was a good time to introduce her to our group and keep her occupied. She got along really well with everyone and as the party went on throughout the night she got particularly close to one of my friends. Everyone began to notice her gropey, flirty actions with him which eventually led them both having sex in his car. 

Last night she texts me asking if I had fun at the party, and then she sends me another text with a picture of him and her this morning showing off her spontaneous trip to Vegas; they both left together that same night during the party. I haven't replied back to her because I feel disgusted and confused about the situation. Am I overreacting and naive? Am I being unreasonable about how I feel? Should I or should I not replay back to her?

1602," Dad refuses to listen to the song ""Sympathy for the Devil"" because of a possible connection to a death of a family member. He has refused to listen to it since I was born. It is a great song.","I've listened to rock my whole life. My dad brought me up on it. I remember as a kid, sifting through all his thousands of vinyl albums, checking out all the cool covers.

Whenever we'd drive around in the car, we would listen to our favorite rock stations. I thought it was cool that my dad loved to crank up the radio, roll the windows down, and just blast tunes. I do that to this day (respectively of course). This always something that was very positive.

BUT, whenever the Rolling Stones ""Sympathy for the Devil"" would come on, he would IMMEDIATELY change the station. Thanks to a love of ""Interview with a Vampire"", I happen to really love this song. I would always be like, ""Dad, that song is awesome. Why did you change it?""

He would just say ""don't ask me about it, but I refuse to listen to it.""

We are not very religious, and are a pretty liberal family. But I remember at least 4-5 times in my childhood, my dad flipping out over this song and never telling me why... still won't to this day.

The only thing I can think of, is an incident where my uncle's best friend was killed a party when everyone was wasted. Apparently there was a handgun, and it was being played around with, and the of course, the worst thing possible happened.

TL;DR: I met a girl in college, we became friends, she rejected me,","We started off as friends about a year ago in college. A few months after I confessed my feelings and she said that she wasn't ready to be in a relationship. So I took it as a rejection and moved on. However, a few weeks before I told her this, she reacted in a very strange way upon hearing news that I would be quitting the club we were both in; she came down to my dorm and started crying hysterically. This really confused me.

Fast forward about almost a year later. I'm taking a year off from school but decide to visit my friends at school. I started texting her again a few weeks prior. So I also meet up with her at one point. We go together (just the two of us) for ice cream, and I decide to pay for the entire thing. She says she will pay next time. I notice that she put on noticeable makeup, which I perceive as a good sign as she doesn't usually wear it. Conversation is flowing, and she is laughing regularly. 

Upon her suggestion, we decide to visit some other mutual friends in their dorm. We all hang out for a bit, and I go to dinner with some other friends. I come back later that evening, and upon hearing I'm back in the dorms, she comes over. But she's dressed in her pajamas. So at this point, I'm thinking, she's way too comfortable with me if she isn't concerned about her being seen in her pajamas.

Next day I leave, so I don't get to see her again. I continue to text her though.

I'm not really sure where I stand with her. She's already rejected me once, but our recent interactions have gotten more flirty. There's a lot more I haven't mentioned, but these are the main points.

Though I had dated plenty of ""Eligible Bachelors"" before, none have hypnotized me so much. He is special. Needless to say, I have been devoted to him since Day 1. I would do anything for him (aside from anything involving needless pain, conflict, or suffering!) but I don't think he would do the same for me. And that's where my concern steps in.

When he broke up with me, he told me it wasn't fair for me to be with someone less devoted than I was. That I deserved someone who would make me a priority, too.

It cut deeply, but he was right. I did need that. Flash forward a few months and we are dating again.

During our break I dated someone else, and my ex suffered the loss of a beloved pet. This person and I broke up, and the ex (now bf) and I got back together.

I've only had two relationships, one where I was rather young (like 12/13, if you want to even call that dating) and it was over good old msn chat! Kinda cute tbf. Both relationships (other was with a 17 year old when I was 16) didn't last long. I also got close with a girl but she ultimately told me to bugger off and another girl I slept with.

Also have rather bad social anxiety, but I dunno, because this girls shy, plus we're both introverted gamers and into the same music and stuff so should be OK...?

On to the question! So, I haven't seen this chick in year and a half, but I messaged her couple days ago saying I miss her (hadn't messaged her since Christmas at this point) and she replied back the same, and then I suggested we meet up, thinking maybe half hour coffee shop thing. 

And this is where the sort of date comes in, because she said that sounds awesome but I'm awful at planning days out. I messaged her saying this thought and she ain't got back to me yet, but assuming she does want it to be a whole day thing... Do I even treat it as a date?

1608, I told my boyfriend's boss that Phil is so charismatic that he has a Hitler level of charisma and all the old Jewish people in the elevator were staring at me in disbelief. I hid in the bathroom to avoid the awkward elevator ride.,"Okay so this actually happened last night, but still in the last 24 hours. Although I wish it wasn't, this story is 100% real.

So I attended my boyfriend's boss's Jewish wedding last night. It had an open bar, lots of dancing - pretty much a good time was had by all. At one point my boyfriend left me alone, so I did what anyone else would do surrounded by a bunch of people they don't know: hop on Reddit. I read the article on the philosophy of killing baby Hitler, which talks a little about how depriving the Nazi party of such a charismatic leader could have been enough to nip WWII in the bud. My boyfriend returns and I get up to dance, still pondering Hitler's infamous charisma.

Let me mention here that the company my SO works for is all Russian guys, save him and this other guy, who we'll call Phil, because that's his name. Now Phil doesn't really fit in with everyone else (as a young, tattooed, black kid he stands out in a room full of Russian Jews) but is literally one of the most charming people I've ever met. He's dancing with grandma, playing with the kids, flirting with the ladies and everyone's eating it up. He's just one of those ""it-factor"" people; EVERYONE loves Phil.

Anyways, we get done dancing the Hora (I think that's what the chair dance is called?) and my boyfriend asks if I want to go down to the hotel's lobby and smoke a cigarette. We're both laughing about how enthusiastic Phil was during the chair dance as we approach the elevator. We stand there with a group of older guests waiting for the elevator, talking about Phil when I say, ""Phil is so charismatic... like he has a Hitler level of charisma."" It was like fucking slow motion as I turn to see all these old Jewish people just staring at me in disbelief. My boyfriend mouths *what the fuck* and I decide there's no way in hell I'm going to ride the elevator 15 floors with these people. I turn around and book it as fast as my stilettos would take me to the bathroom and hid.

We work in an industry where we must have someone in the office 7 days a week. Of course, weekend shifts are not popular. And we usually have 2 people work each day of the weekend: one early shift until midday, and then someone relieves them for the late shift.

Occasionally we will help each other out by trading around shifts. For example, one person might work ALL of Saturday, and then the next personal ALL of Sunday so that we each get one full weekend day, rather than working part of both.

This arrangement works well, and we're happy to help each other out if someone requests to trade. But lately, one of my coworkers seems to be exploiting this for his own gain. He's been there the longest, and likes to joke about ""seniority"". 

Basically, a couple weeks ago, we were scheduled to work a weekend together. He ""graciously"" offered to work the entire Saturday, giving me the full day off. When I told him I already had plans Sunday evening (and thus couldn't trade a day for a day), he said that was ok and that I would just ""owe"" him a day.

This weekend is very similar. And now I offered to even things up by working a full day for him. I hate having this hang over me, especially if he tries to cash it in when it's inconvenient for me. So I offered that to him this morning.

His response? ""That's ok. I can work this weekend. I think I'll save it for another time.""

That annoys me. He was the one who offered to work for me, when it was convenient for *him*, even though I didn't require it. And now he's trying to use that favor to his advantage, only cashing it in when it benefits him the most.

1614," GF has 0 libido, 0 desire to be intimate outside of sex, but still has sex whenever she wants it. She's very selfish in bed, and it leaves me feeling unsatisfied and unwanted. What do?","Alright guys - hoping that I can get some helpful advice here because I'm really struggling.

I'm 25, my gf is 24. We met in college, have been together nearly 5 years (not married yet, and I'm very on the fence about whether or not that's where we're headed), and have lived together for the last 2. My situation is a bit odd - she absolutely loves sex. Whenever we have a chance to do it, it's on. 

Outside of sex (and I mean actual PIV intercourse), she has 0 libido, 0 desire to be intimate in any way. She had to have an operation ""down there"" at one point which meant we couldn't have sex for 2 months, and in that time we basically never did anything sexual - there was one time that I feel guilty about because it took a lot of convincing on my part. She also has had to change birth controls multiple times this year so far, and each time it messes with her hormones and she ends up on her period for 2-3 weeks out of the month. Same store each time - if we can't have sex, nothing is going to happen.

I don't like thinking about it this way, but everything leaves me with the impression that she's extremely selfish in the bedroom. I've always been a bit of a giver - I'm generally not just happy, but eager to go down on her and I legitimately enjoy it when she gets off - to the point that sometimes when she's on her period I'll still do things to get her off, and she almost never returns the favor (at most, once every 3-4 months). On the flip side, if she's out of commission for one reason or another though, there's nothing I can do to get her in the mood to fool around at all. I hate the cliched ""I have needs too"" statement, but it's true. 

I don't know what to do - I really, really love her and love being with her, but the lack of intimacy leaves me feeling more often than not that she's more of a great roommate than a romantic partner.

I also have diabetes which makes travel a little difficult because I have to plan in advance so that I can take enough medical supplies with me (so I'm not trying to get into any sort of nomadic lifestyle). Does anyone have any tips on where I should begin? Articles to read? Websites to check out? Personal stories to share?

1618, I love my ex-gf so much that I can't stop thinking about her but she doesn't love me back and I don't know if I should go to a wedding we were both invited to when we were dating (we both know the,"So a bit of backstory. Me and my ex-girlfriend met in work almost 2 years ago, I was 18, she was 20. We instantly hit it off and I asked her out after a month, she said yes.

Things went pretty well for most of it. She was the first person I had sex with and I was her first boyfriend who treated her right. But the last 2 or 3 months of our relationship became a little bit rocky. I worked a lot and she had University so we struggled to see each other. I'm also not much of a texter but I really tried for her because I know she wanted to talk to me even though it wasn't enough.

A few times in those months I myself questioned whether we where meant to be together but whenever I thought about not having her in my life I felt sick. I knew I still loved her. But back in mid March she texted me telling me we had to meet up because she wanted to tell me something in person. I told her that all I could think was that she either cheated on me or was breaking up with me, so really I forced her into breaking up with me over text.

The first few days where kind of shit but I got over her relatively quickly, and after a week I wasn't really thinking about her at all. But about 2 weeks ago someone mentioned something to do with her and all these feelings I had for her instantly came rushing back like a tidal wave and I felt sick knowing she didn't love me anymore.

So I've basically spent the last 2 weeks with the intense feeling of butterflies in my stomach because I love this person so much that I can't stop thinking about them but knowing they don't love me back.

I have the opportunity to go to a wedding we where both invited to when we where dating (we both know the people getting married) but since she's a bridesmaid she's obviously going to be there so it's kinda been taken for granted that I'm not going even though I still work with the bride and everyone I work with (about 70 people) is going. I don't know if I should go or not.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am 32 years old, and have been an attorney for four years.  My wife has a post-graduate degree in social work and has been working as a consultant with unstable income, because of having two kids in the last few years.  We did not manage our income and debt terribly well during either of the post-birth income dips, and have accumulated a lot of debt.  We also have lots of student debt.

**The State of Our Finances**

I put together a snapshot of our finances [here](

**Goals**

* Pay down our unsecured debt
* Build up an emergency fund
* Make space to invest in retirement and college savings
* Eliminate unnecessary expenditures and investments

**A couple of miscellaneous points**:

First, about $300/mo. of our insurance payments go to whole life policies.  I cannot tell from the literature whether that makes any sense, but my gut is telling me to get rid of those policies.

Second, childcare is a huge line item in our monthly budget, but that will be steadily decreasing as our children grow older and childcare costs either decrease or are replaced by lower private school tuition (I live in a city where nobody sends their children to public schools if they can afford private schools).

My stated income does not account for yearly bonuses, which have averaged about $10,000, but I started at a new firm recently so I am not certain what bonuses will be going forward.  I expect my income to increase every year until I retire.

My new firm will not match any 401(k) contributions until I have one year on the job (approximately 9 months from now).  I am not currently contributing to my 401(k).

Due to the fact that I'm a college student I haven't had all that much time to dedicate to anyone (maybe that's just an excuse, but regardless)

Anyway, I recently met this girl that I immediately clicked with. My recent trend throughout the college years has been mostly casual hookups and very very light dating, but with her things have been different. We've been out in public together, we've held hands and kissed in public, she's spent the night multiple times where we have just fallen asleep, spooning one another, and even dates have happened - god I haven't taken a girl on an actual date in years so this feels huge. 

I find myself constantly wanting to talk to her and hang out with her, and it feels so weird because I'm not usually like this to that extent. 

It's still pretty recent, all of this, so I know I can't really say with full confidence that it means anything, and maybe it's just a lack of confidence in the situation, but I wonder if this is as real as I think it is.

So yesterday was my birthday and my ex texted me a happy birthday. After 2 months of no texting and me doing my best to avoid looking at her facebook or anything I texted her back saying thanks. We texted a little bit, not much after and I hate to say it but after doing it I felt like shit. I don't know if it was because she told me how she doesn't remember where she parked her car or what but the rest of the day I felt off. My mind raced with ideas, did she go home drunk with some guy? Did they have sex? Or was she with a new boyfriend? Or did she go out with friends? Why am I thinking about this? I've been having trouble not thinking about her and this didn't help.

I'm doing my best to move on from her. I'm going to the gym and trying to do new things, although this -10 degree weather in Wisconsin isn't helping me get out. I'm afraid that she will take my responses as she can start texting me again. I don't want to talk to her. I'm not ready to. Every time I do I feel worse. Should I tell her this? Should I just ignore her texts? Last time we texted I told her I didn't think it'd be a good idea to hang out and she got mad it seemed and didn't text me until now. I guess I want to be honest with her and tell her that texting her ruins my day but I don't want her mad at me again. Maybe I shouldn't care either way.

How should I proceed with this? I'm asking you guys because I feel like my friends are getting annoyed if I talk about her to them. Like I should be over this by now and they're tired of hearing about her.

So I have an amazing girlfriend of 1 year. Everything's perfect except how she is when she gets drunk. She's the type to just go crazy all over the place and completely lose it, which is fine I guess I can put up with that, but she also gets really flirty.

Over the past year, she's had two incidences; one where she flirted with some bartender, even taking a photo, getting really touchy and all, and once where she made out with a good friend of hers. Granted, ""[but] he's gay op!"" but I'm still not okay with that. Both times she also went around getting touchy with every guy she ran into.

Now I've tried talking with her about these things but she always responds in horror saying ""oh now I can actually see us breaking up cos you don't trust me anymore"" cue crying which is really unfair when
A) it's not my fault I'm having trust issues right now
B) by talking I'm trying to fix the issue and her reshifting the focus isn't helping any, only making me feel worse.

Once, I finally got through and she apologized, promised not to do it anymore, etc... Which was great. I finally felt at peace. Or so I thought. Flash forward to now and I can't seem to get over it. Every time she tells me she's going out with friends to go drinking I can't help but worry inside and it sucks. I'd try talking to her again but I don't want another giant fight. It also doesn't help that we're LDR and she frequently has things lined up (I.e. A giant annual street party at her city where the entire city gets soaked in beer. It's that big, one of our bigger tourist attractions) and so I have to worry for periods of times, what if she gets drunk and starts flirting again, etc...

1628, Vet said our dog has a hygroma behind his elbow that needs to be surgically drained and will need to be kept inactive for 2 weeks. We're going to make sure he has a lot of padded areas to rest and we'll put heat,"So we just got back from the vet. We took our 10-month old Plott Hound/Boxer pup in because he seems to have a fluid sac behind his right elbow. It hasn't caused him any pain but it's been there for almost 2 weeks and when we called the vet's office to ask about it, the nurse suggested we bring him in to get it looked at. She warned me that our regular vet wasn't in today and we would be seeing another vet. I can't get off work next week and I figured anyone taking the place of our awesome vet would be just as awesome.

We go in, the guy takes one look at our dog, doesn't touch him once and says ""Oh yeah, that's a hygroma. You'll need to have that surgically drained. We'll have to put him out, drain it, then he'll have to have drainage tubes in for the next week. Oh, and you'll have to keep him completely inactive for 2 weeks."" Our dog has a hard time holding still for 5 minutes... there's no way he's going to go more than a day without running and playing without heavy sedatives. At this point, we were like, ""uh ok, well if the swelling doesn't go down in a week we'll bring him back in."" Cool, $54, have a nice day.

I got home and did some searching about [hygromas] The accepted treatment seems to be ""make sure they stop damaging the area, put heat on it, take him back to the vet for correction if it gets really big."" A lot of sites say that surgery is rarely done and, if it is, it's done when the dog is older and the hygroma has gotten large and/or infected. So we're going to make sure he has a lot of padded areas to rest and we'll put heat on it. We'll even take him to see our regular vet before too long to get his opinion.

I guess I'm just irked that the vet jumped immediately to expensive surgery without even really examining the dog or discussing with us what would happen if we don't get surgery. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I've had an intermittent crush on this girl for quite a few years, and only recently noticed a great opportunity to start talking to her, and things have been going quite well. I even manage to stay incredibly calm and composed when with her, and that's never happened when hanging out with other girls. 

The second time we arranged to meet (wouldn't call it a date though) was at a gym, where she met (or went) with her ex. They seemed to be good old friends, but not more than that. She never introduced him to me as her ex, I just know because he has the same surname as her ex-brother-in-law she once mentioned. (Brother-in-law meaning the brother of her boyfriend) 

When the opportunity arose, I invited her to have dinner in a place nearby – if she wasn't already going out with the ex, that is. She said she was, and invited me to accompany them to dinner. She went in his car and I in mine. It was nice and almost only the two of us talked, besides, her body language and specially eye contact were much more meaningful towards me than him.

Now I don't quite know what to make of it. I know it raises a few red flags, but I intend to take my chances regardless. Is such a close relationship with exes normal? How should I interpret her willingness to have a ""triple date"" and having me meet him (or the other way around)?

And would it be alright to ask her something along the lines of ""so he's [ex-brother-in-law's name]'s brother?"" just to make sure what I'm dealing with? How should I phrase things next time to ensure we go out just the two of us without sounding rude?

I'm a rather patient person so I can certainly wait until she feels ready however, I believe that having a good sexual connection with your partner is essential to a healthy relationship so if that isn't ever going to happen then it will most certainly be a deal breaker for me.

The day after I said it I told him I felt like an idiot and he told me not to.  I wrote up some of my thoughts (really short, in bullet form) and gave it to him, but he didn't even say anything about it.

I'm just wondering if I'm wasting my time with this.  I like him a lot but if it's not going anywhere and he doesn't feel that strongly about me, then what's the point?  Should I wait it out longer or move on?

TL;DR: Boyfriend is bragging about how much better he is at his new job than everyone","My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year now. We are both 20. He recently got a new job and I am so happy for him because he was looking for a really long time and is happy where he is. However, he will not stop bragging about how good he is at this new job. Everyday that I see him after work, he spends nearly the whole time talking about how fast he is learning everything, how much everyone likes him, how nobody does the work as good as he does, how managers love him, how he works harder than everybody else, how the management doesn't see all the good things he does and if they did they would be rewarding him, etc. 

I'm happy for him. He's confident. I get it. But seriously, have some modesty. I feel like I am seeing a side of him that I've never seen before and I don't like it. I know it's not worth bringing up with him because it will just lead to a stupid fight. How to I deal with this? I am having a hard time ignoring it.

1640," I have a new, gorgeous, potentially serious relationship with a woman who lives far away and I don't know if I can handle breaking up with my long-term girlfriend to pursue it. Is it worth the pain to keep dating her (or anyone","I just started a new job, and I've really hit it off with this gorgeous coworker. She's clearly interested in me too and has been dropping hints that I should ask her out sometime. I have no way of knowing if things could even work out between us (for one thing, I'm pretty religious and I don't even know if she is, which would be a dealbreaker for me) but something in me really wants to try it.

The problem is that I've put off mentioning to this girl that I'm in a pretty serious long-distance relationship with my girlfriend of three years. In fact, I'm considering marrying her. We've been dating since the summer before my freshman year of college, and I really do love her, but our relationship can be rocky sometimes. My friends have said that they think I'm good for her but they're not convinced that she's good for me.

The fact that we're long-distance makes things harder, because I only get to see her once or twice a year. I've only dated one girl before this so I don't know if I'm missing out on a really fulfilling, amazing relationship.

I don't want to lead this new girl on so I need to make a decision either way. If I decide to pursue something with this coworker, it's going to break my heart to end things with my current girlfriend. We've talked about marriage and she's expecting it at this point, so I'm scared of destroying her emotionally if I leave. Is it worth that pain for me to continue getting to know this new woman and possibly even end things with my current SO?

1642, Uncle is a scumbag who has demanded money from my mum and uncle and threatened to tell my mum's family about the bad stuff he has done in the past if the money isn't paid. What can my mum and uncle do to get rid,"For this I'll call Uncle 1 Harry and Uncle 2 Justin, hopefully this'll make things easier to understand.

Okay, so last night uncle Harry was sent a message from Justin which demanded £10,000 from both my mum and Harry or ""There will be hell"" and he knows where we both live.

Many years ago Harry and Justin co-owned a shop which they both had a share in but they fell out and Justin left the family a note saying that he had decided to disown the family. Harry could not afford to keep up the shop on his own so he had to remortgage his parents house. Through these years my uncle Justin has not contacted most of the family and we had no idea of what he was doing, where he was living e.t.c.

When he was younger Justin tended to mix with the wrong crowd and at one point he apparently was involved with an organised crime group. He has always had money problems and has had my mum pay for his car in the past because he didn't have the money. He also ran away from him parents home too for a long time when he was younger. I also found out that he has asked my cousin for money too.

I don't know all the details of my mum and uncles' relationships but I know that my uncle mingled with the wrong crowds and disowned the family and I haven't seen him for years. My mum can't walk around the house without looking worried. I've never done a post before so hopefully this all makes sense.

She had just argued with her parents that I couldn't help her dad move stuff from their old house because I was busy studying. She walked in at the absolute worst time because the hours leading up to that moment I had been studying.

She is very angry and I felt embarrassed trying to explain that it was not because I was turned on I just needed to relax a moment and keep studying. She thinks I don't find her attractive which is not true.  I don't know if this is only true of me or men in general but most of the time it is not a sexual thing.  It just helps relieve stress.

I recently broke my leg and gained a lot of weight during that time. Sex isn't as appealing for me because of how I feel, not because of her. I tried to explain it to her but she is still very upset. How do other women feel who may have been in a similar situation? What should I do?

1645, I have no idea what to say to my sister during the wedding dinner. I want to tell her that the last 6 years didn't give us the best of opportunities to get to know each other better (maybe humorously).,"Situation: My sister, 26, is getting married the end of this year. I have no clue what to say for my speech during the reception dinner. 

Background: I am very happy for her and everyone is on board with the guy. Families have met each other, and they've been together almost a decade. It's not like I do not know the guy, I know him in a sense that I know what he's like, I've hung out with him. For the last 6 years, we've lived separately. Me in North America, she back in Asia where we were born and raised. It made it difficult for me to be close to her, or get to know her boyfriend to a greater extent. We were close growing up, puberty to teenage years. We were so comfortable with each other taking selfies and other playful stuff. Then at some point, for some reason, we kinda strayed. No bad bloods no ill feelings, but we weren't as close as we were before. Chalk it up to growing up and having different priorities and interests?Again, the last 6 years (we've seen each other a few times during this period) didn't help. 

Assessment: It makes it difficult for me to come up with an honest, touching brotherly speech when the day of the wedding comes. We were never the type to hang out with each other's friends when we got a little older. 

Recommendation (what I think): Part of the speech will include memories of us as kids, part of it will also admitting that the last 6 years of not being around each other didn't give us the best opportunity (maybe come off as humorous?)

I feel ridiculous because all weddings I've been to it seems like siblings have the beat stories of the bride/groom and their partners.

We were friends through high school and a few years into college, in 2012, we hooked up and it stayed that way since then. 

In early 2014 her father had to relocate due to his job and her whole family had to go to a city 5000 km away. We live in Brazil, I live in Porto Alegre (extreme south) and she now lives in Boa Vista (extreme north). We didn't break up or anything at the time because we really like each other and she was supposed to to come back in 2016 and during college breaks we could visit each other.

Last month she told me her father is not comming back, neither is she. Also, we both can't visit this year because of many reasons (I study mechanical engineering and recently got a job in a big company). So it may take years since we see each other again.

I like VERY much, but since the day she told me that it may take a few years for she to come back, I've been doubting where this relationship is going. I truly like her, but I don't think I love her anymore. It is really confusing to me, on one side I really care for her and want to be with her but on the other side I am kind of accepting the fact that we won't be able to see each other again and I'm ready to let each of us go our ways.

He has now conveniently moved where I am and called me up to help him set up his own business to sponsor himself to stay in the country. He has asked if i will sign a couple of documents to be the 'director' of his subcontracting company as he needs someone he can trust and he doesn't really have anyone else to ask. I feel obliged to do it, as that if I don't, he has to leave the country. Even although he upset me (through minor infidelity -  which is why we broke up) I still want whats the best for him and for him to say in the country. He is manipulating me by telling me he will pay me a wage if i do this 'favour' for him.

The reason why i haven't blocked him out of my life is I do think he is a good guy, I am all he has in terms of a good friend and he still owes me some money which he has been paying me back.

1649, I was signed up for a class at a community college that was never paid for. Debt was sold to collections agency. What are my options and how much will it cost me to hire a lawyer to handle the debt collection.,"Almost 2 years ago I met with an advisor at a community college. I had full intent to being a few online courses assuming that they were within my budget. I took the aptitude test and was given a list of classes that I should consider. She even showed me how to use their website to sign up for classes and then I left. 

I decided not to enroll at the time since my hours were cut at work and I had real bills to worry about. 

After a few weeks I got curious about the courses being offered next semester and logged into their portal. When I checked my .edu email I saw several notices for an online class. I had no idea that the advisor had signed me up for a class while what I though was a demonstration. I was never even asked to pay for the class at the time and had never logged into the course before that day. 

So begins the problem…

I tried to drop the class but it was too late. I tried to reach out to the college but they denied removing me from the class. About a year ago the debt was sold to a collections company who have been hounding me ever since.

I've tried to explain to everyone why I don't feel responsible for the debt. I've pretty much dodge the collectors for a year. 

Today I answered a call from the collector thinking it was a call I was expecting. I explained to him again why I did not feel responsible for the debt.  I told him I was going to seek legal representation and he inquired what steps I've taken since this is the first time I've mentioned doing so. He got a little upset and continued to try to guilt me into accepting the debt. I requested that he no longer call and to send everything by mail. At first he ignored my request and asked again about who was representing me. I told him firmly again to mail me. 

What are my options here? Can I seek legal representation? I've never had to do anything like this before.

Last spring, my crush (at the time)'s best friend gave me her number. We chatted about school and life, but never expressed any feelings for one another, although did talk about past relationships. She was aware that I had a crush on her best friend, and was actually cool enough to help me out with her. I never did ask the my then-crush out though, mostly just because I was too nervous.

Fast forward to this fall, and the situation is still the same. This girl and I chat often, and she's trying to help me out with my crush. However, as the school year goes on, I realize that I don't really like my crush anymore - I begin to see that she is shallow and somewhat unkind. On the other hand, I realize that I have feelings for this girl that I've been talking to since last spring about another girl.

How do I turn this situation around? This girl still thinks that I'm infatuated with her best friend, and I haven't given any indication of anything else to her. We've talked about all sorts of personal stuff, and I just feel weird turning to a person with whom one of the primary focuses of our relationship was setting me up with someone else. After that, will she feel that she's only an afterthought to another attraction? She probably thinks that I see her as just a friend and feels that I'm just a friend to her too.

My girlfriend, of 4 years, suffers from performance anxiety after being bullied during her early teens (before she knew me and for the for the first year of our relationship). She got good grades at GCSE (yep, from THAT side of the pond) from grades A-C in 10 subjects. Since then she has failed all but a couple of modules in her A levels. I am not too keen on submitting exactly what her A levels are, she has been known to browse reddit on occasion, but lets say they are not easy subjects. She currently has offers from 4 universities in the UK, all requiring very low grades that reflect her AS level performance, however her school are skeptical as to whether she will meet them. I have always been supportive of my girlfriend and would never want to even discuss any alternative arrangements as I don't want to make her feel as if I am doubting her, however should things not go to plan I don't want to find myself in an awkward situation, unable to help. I am worried that she may not get into university and really just wanted to know how reddit felt, without it turning into a circlejerk on pro/anti-university. It is stressful for my girlfriend as she works so hard, gets good marks in her practice papers only to see the grades slip through her fingers when it gets to crunch time. I have offers to do Economics to 3 Top 10 Universities and can say hand on heart she has alot to offer. I will however be very busy once I start my courses in late september and will therefore not be in the best position to help her at all times. So ladies and gentlemen or reddit, I am therefore asking you your opinion and/or experience on what she should do should she not be able to get into university and, perhaps in a way more importantly, in what ways might I be as supportive as possible.

I also know the ins and outs of IT project management, the tools to use and the reasoning behind correct decisions in IT project management.

I also have a boyfriend and stay at his apartment 2 nights per week on average (the weekend). However, over the past few months, Derek has started staying at our apartment every single night. Our apartment building has the option to pay extra each month for a parking spot, and he is currently paying that amount to keep her car there so he can drive it to work every day. He also has his own apartment with a few roommates, but they only ever go there if there's a specific reason to, like a party or something, which might be every couple weeks.

So, he is basically at our apartment all the time, even if she is not there. He does stay in her room, but it still changes the entire feel of the apartment. When we signed the lease (which is not cheap), we were agreeing to pay a certain amount to live with two people we were very close with, but now we are paying that same large amount to live with those 2 people (1 which we are much less close to now) and another person who we barely even know. 

In addition to this, they act very sketchy when we are home. They sneak around to take showers and to leave the apartment. They also cook dinner in the kitchen most nights and do not acknowledge us at all if we go into the kitchen during this. Ann and I have started to keep our bedrooms doors shut most of the time. Our apartment is VERY small. There is a tiny room that all of the bedrooms, the kitchen, and the bathroom are off of. This apartment does not feel like ours anymore, and Ann and I are struggling with what to do. We do not want to create a hostile environment, but this is just unfair. Please help!

1658," I want to break up with my gf of 2 years but it feels weird because everything is normal between us and when I decide to break up with her it will be like a shock... one day we go outside, meet friend, etc and the","Here's my story:

About two years ago my ex girlfriend of many years broke up with me due to LDR. Naturally I was quite devastated and had this massive hole in me which needed to be filled badly. This is where my current gf comes in. We started seeing eachother a few month after my break up and things started progressing. At this point I wasn't sure if I wanted that but she was somewhat pushy and I accepted it thinking that I'd give it a change and see what happens. Fast forwards 2 years - I don't feel anything special about her. We don't fight, everything is normal and I enjoy her company most of the time, but she might as well be my sister. Furthermore, we live together which means that I have very little personal space and I'm feeling like strangled. 

That's why I've been thinking of enidng it for a few months now but I can't gather the courage. What bugs me is the fact that everything is normal between us and when I decide to break up with her it will be like a shock... one day we go outside, meet friend, etc and the other ""hey we're breaking up"". I just seems weird to me.

I don't know if I'm looking for an advice. Maybe I just wanted to put my thoughts into writing. Thanks for reading.

1659," I met a married man who has a history with me and we fell for each other. He wants to end his marriage and move on with me. I feel guilty, but I really want to date him. What do?","I had the biggest crush on Matt all throughout high school. He was the popular guy and I never really felt like I had a chance with him. We knew of each other, but never really mingled. I just felt like I wasn't popular enough for him. I eventually graduated and moved out of state for college, in which I have been gone ever since. I'm currently dating around, but not committed. 

 So, fast forward to now… He recently wrote me on Facebook randomly confessing that he had a big crush on me and that his crush on me has never stopped. He said that he always felt like he wasn't good enough for me (ha!) and so he never pursued it. He said he felt it was finally time to let me know. I found out that he had become a family friend, and those family members love him to death. I brought it up to them, and they told me that he has asked about me over the years and that it was obvious that he has been in love with me since high school. He is a great guy with a good reputation too.

So, here's the kicker...he's married. They've been together for over 10 years. She apparently cheated on him last year and moved out, but they got back together soon after. She also is about 8 years older than he is. He told me that they have grown apart and that he doesn't think it will last much longer. He feels that the cheating changed his heart. 

So, we talked for a while. We fell for each other. I'm confused. I broke off communication recently after feeling guilty that I was falling for a married man. I can't help it though...normally I'd dismiss a married man flirting with me as a dog, but this feels different because of our history. I've done the right thing, right? I'd really like some advice on this, as I feel we would be perfect for one another, but i don't want to be the other woman.

I don't necessarily think she'd physically cheat on me, but it seems like she has 101 backup guys that she's always talking to.

TL;DR: I'm confused as to whether me being annoyed is","Me[21] and my SO[21] are in a long distance relationship that works out very well. We have been madly in love for around a year now and visit each other as much as physically possible (Very LDR). 
She has always been the type to have more guy friends than girlfriends and i've never had jealousy over that, as we are both pretty laid back. The problem recently is my SO and her best friend tend to go to shows / bars and then some how end up back at people (normally guys) houses. Before the obvious ''she is cheating on you'' comes around, I can wholeheartedly say I trust her with my life and know she would never cheat on me. Last night she went to a show and the same thing happened, I woke up to a message, ''we went back to some people's house after the show, they were nice though!'' and it annoyed me a lot, and i'm not sure why. 
When I was last over visiting she mentioned if her ''new friends'' would be out (she hadn;t remembered there names(2 guys her and her friend dont seem to know to well but go and chill with sometimes (they smoke them out))). Upon saying this, her flatmate asked ''do they know about'' and pointed to me while I wasn't really looking. Too which my SO replied ''I don't know, I don't know when I would have ever really said''. 
This all sounds very dodgy and maybe it's just my head painting it in that light, but she is a very transparent person and like I said, I whole heatedly trust her.
My only confusion is in my country, to go back with some people (girls for my case) I met at a show, that would mean a lot of back and forth chatting while out, and a lot of suggestion towards something sexual. Maybe it is very different in America? I'm really not too sure.

Is there a way to make it not","I've known him (I'll refer to him as ""M"") for about a full year now, when I moved schools. We bonded over a shared passion for English and similar bands back then. He introduced me to all his friends and I felt so accepted, so welcome -- like I meant something to M and all his friends. In the weeks that followed, M and I got a lot closer: I went to see his band's gigs, which really surprised but really touched him a lot, too (he told me so himself - that it meant a lot to him), he invited me to parties, we caught the team home together, we paired up in class, etc. 

But then there's periods of time (like, around two weeks or so - started being a thing this year) where I may as well not even exist to him. He won't sit with me in class, he doesn't initiate conversations with me unless he absolutely has to, he ignores my presence, he doesn't smile at me, when I try talking with him he'll give short, disinterested answers... And then, two weeks later, he'll be back to ""normal"", smiling at me all the time, sitting next to me, messaging me, liking my FB posts, we have conversations that make me feel like it's not our ears that are doing all the listening, but our souls instead. He'll tell me out of the blue that he likes my T-shirt, or my dress, or the essay I read to our Literature class that day, he'll walk with me to the tram before we catch it home together... I love these days. I feel like I mean something to him when he's like this. 

And then right when I feel like it's all okay again, it'll cycle back into that two-week or so period where he'll start avoiding me again, taking the train when he sees that I'm off to get the tram, keeping a distance from me in class... :(

I didn't need to get a lot of visitors, but if people would actually read what I had to say, I would be a very happy camper.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I checked the stats to a youtube video I made and found out 1/3 of the views came from my blog. That was great! So I checked the stats from my blog and found out that since last august the pageviews are steadily increasing. Last month alone I recieved around 1200. Thankfully the blog gave me the links that viewed my blog most and then I got sad.

The links are almost all to stock pictures I use to brighten up my posts. I don't know if I should be happy for the views or feel down, because my posts are probably not read.

Now there are people reading my blog, I've had a comment on one post and I got some great reactions of people I know who heard about it from other friends. The problem is they get drowned under all these google image hits.

What to do? Should I remove the pictures? Should I just take mother Mary's advice and let it be? Is there a good way to generate traffic to my blog aside from posting links on reddit?

1666," I have a lot of feelings for an ex that I can't get over, and I feel like I'm not even close to being over her, and I have no clue how to deal with the situation, or how to move on from her.","Around 2-3 years ago on Christmas day me and the ex, got in to an argument that ended our 8 year relationship, the argument consisted of pretty much every flaw we had inside and outside of our relationship. I won't go in to too many details about the argument.  
  
Since the argument we had talked once when she got ahold of me on AIM, she had moved on completely and I still had many built up feelings for her and in my star struck (Because I didn't think she would EVER contact me) state I admitted all of the built up emotions and feelings to her. The next day after realizing what I had done, sent her an offline message basically breaking contact once again since she had moved on and I obviously had not and was feeling extremely vulnerable to what she was able to make me admit to her.  
  
Fast forward 2 years, and 4 failed relationships (Different reasons) later, and I'm feeling like I'm not even close to being over this yet and I have no clue how to proceed and am feeling frustrated and still hurt about the whole situation. She pops in to my mind at least twice a week still (And this has stayed consistence even while I was in relationships which may have led to their failure) and has very often been in my dreams which consist of her coming back in to my life, which I can feel are happy and I wake up happy until I realize the dreams have involved her.  
  
Contacting her in any way is completely out of the question, she has a kid, a husband, and as far as I know never thinks about me for a second, plus I'd rather just avoid it, I still feel completely vulnerable even given her circumstances. The relationship with her was my most successful and happy relationship to date, I suppose that may also be the cause of how I feel.  
  
I suppose I'm trying to get some advice and/or support with my situation as well as venting and getting it out there to people who don't know me or the person in question.

I'm well aware there are a lot of books geared towards people in their mid-20s, as well as those geared towards paying off student loan debt, but I don't think there's something in the middle that deals with a blend of the two—young, anxious about loans, but eager to start investing.

Thus, I'm using my own personal experiences (27M, lawyer) to write a personal finance book that sorts out everything I've learned thus far. The goals of my book are as follows:

(1) Stress financial behavior and personal finance basics rather than super crazy tricks of the trade.

(2) For college kids: discuss how to keep student loan debt down and keys to finding a job.

(3) For recent grads: reducing fixed costs, picking the right student loan repayment plan, balancing investing with student loans, etc.

(4) Basics of investing (401k, IRAs, etc.)

(5) Ultimately, make everything easy so those in my generation have the confidence and ability to have a healthy financial life.

That's the extremely basic outline thus far. I've written chapters 1-3 and it seems to be coming along pretty well, but I figured I should reach out to /r/personalfinance and see if anybody had some input.

So what would you stress? What are some things I might be taking for granted? What are unique challenges a 20 year old faces now versus a 20 year old in 1990? Etc.

me and my girlfriend have been dating for two and a half years. We started out long distance about 5 hours away when we were both around 18. We saw each other every now in then when we could via greyhound(shitty bus service). We disliked the long distance and made plans to move in with each other for college after high school. We did this for 2 years and recently have moved back up to her house. However, the past several months including before the move she has been seeming less interested. This reached its peak when we our now not living together and I am living with her brother of 21, 30min away(I am good friends with him). Their is pros and cons to this situation such as i was able to get a job, her house is kinda shit, and the school up here is allot closer, but the bottom line is we are not living together anymore due to her feelings of disconnect. It may be a good thing because we are young and living together can take its tole.

We still have sex, but not as much. What I mean is we use to have allot of sex sometimes three times a day everyday(yes, it was good times), and this was mostly because of her wants I suppose mine as well. Now its about two to four times a week, and they all seem to be brought on by me not her.  She also seems less interested in conversation, and many of my attempts seem to be shot down due to lack of interest. This was only somewhat true before as allot of the shit I talk about is random, but she would humor me basically all the time if she didn't care. I was perfectly fine with that.

However I love my family and don't want to cause disappointment, so I can't live with someone before marriage. He knew this and said I was worth it. He wanted to. I told my parents about him which is something that was hard for me to do. Throughout it all he said he was ok with it. I kept giving him opportunities to back out. He refused to take them. 

He told me his depression was getting worse. He said it wasn't because of my issues. We said we'd work through his depression together. He dumped me 3 weeks ago and only yesterday did he say actually it was because of all my issues. He didn't want to be there for me anymore. It was too much.

1676," I'm scared that we'll get married because it's the right thing to do, but it might damage our relationship. Is there a way to avoid getting married if we don't feel the need to, but still feel like a couple?","We've been together for almost seven years and we never felt the need to get married, we've bought a house together, a car, made financial decisions together and so on. We feel like a married couple, but our families and friends keep asking when we're going to get married, why we don't want to get married, want to know if we're having problems and things like that. We think marriage is really a huge thing, especially here (Italy), where getting a divorce takes at least 3 years and quite some money spending, besides that we wouldn't have problems getting married, but we talked about it and what came out of it was: if we never thought about it, there must be a reason. I'm scared we're going to rush trough it just because ""it's the right thing to do"" and it'll damage our relationship.

1677," Dad died when I was young, and my sister and I grew up not knowing much about his family. I want to reconnect with her, but don't know how to go about it, or if it's even worth the effort.","Growing up, I was raised with the value that family is an important source of support and love. Although my immediate family didn't live close to any of my other relatives, my mom always made sure that my sister and I had a chance to regularly visit her side of the family, and so I got to grow up with my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, even though they were far away. My mom made sure that we stayed in touch, and it's something that I'll always value about my childhood, even if some parts of it got rough. My dad, however, didn't really talk too much about his family. By the time I came around, there was only my grandmother, and my dad's sister and her husband. They lived really far away, so I only ever got to see my grandma twice before she passed away. My aunt lived in the same area, so I didn't see her much, either. 

Flash back to ten years ago, and my dad is killed in an accident. My aunt and uncle come up for the funeral, and we're all in grief and shock, but other than that we were effectively strangers, connected by being the only ones left of my dad's family. After my dad died, my aunt kept in touch with my sister and I for a little while, but it petered off after a year or so. I know, though, that my sister has stayed in pretty regular contact with her, and I feel a bit guilty about not keeping up myself. I let it slip away being overwhelmed by college, and never really reached out. I'd like to change that, and start to have a relationship with her again. I want to know more about her, about where my family comes from. I just don't know what to say. I do have her address and contact info, at least. How do you reconnect with someone you haven't spoken to in years and know practically nothing about? Any help would be very much appreciated.

1681, I was accused of cheating in an exam because I made notes at the side of a paragraph referring to another paragraph in my law book. What should I do? Is my case even reasonable? Did anyone of you had a similar experience? What was your,"Hi. 

So I'm a senior at a German university. I'm currently writing my masters thesis and in my LAST exam I took, I'm accused of cheating. 

Here is what happened.

It was an exam about international taxation. I'n all my classes we were always allowed to use so called ""uncommented laws"" as a help, meaning we were not allowed to write anything in our law books EXCEPT underline the text AND make a note at the side of a paragraph referring to another paragraph. But said note was only allowed to be a number - no written text, i.e. next to the paragraph 3 of the Income Law I draw a number 4 referring to paragraph 4. 
This was always allowed and its still always referred as ""uncommented"". 

However, at this exam about international taxation the prof didn't allow said notes at the side of a paragraph referring to a different one. He still allowed underlining. 
Yet, he still called it ""uncommented"" as well. 

So therefore I wasn't aware that this prof had a different definition of ""uncommented"" than all the other profs at my university. 
So, at the beginning of the exam, right after it was handed out, the supervisor checked my law book and of course said it was not allowed b/c these notes were in it. He took it away and I had to take the exam without it. But no problem there. I managed somehow. 

Afterwards the prof accused me of trying to cheat, which would result in a F. 
I tried to explain the situation of the different definitions of ""uncommented"" and that I simply made mistake. Yet, the commission did not rule in my favor. 

As of now I have 4 weeks to reply to that decision or I have to take the exam again (also in about 4 weeks).

What should I do? Get a lawyer? Let it slide? Is my case even reasonable? Did anyone of you had a similar experience?

He is really an amazing guy; brings me flowers every once in a while, helps volunteer at a few local shelters, and understands me like no previous partner has, to name a few things.

The ""catch"" is that I recently saw him browsing reddit on parts related to 9/11 ""truther"" claims. He wasn't posting but just browsing posts about how it was an inside job, the commission report was a cover-up, etc.

I was pretty shocked and asked him if he believed that stuff. He jokingly said that he didn't wear any tinfoil hats or anything but did examine the evidence and found that the official story was lacking. He said that in light of the gulf of tonkin, etc. the official story should be put to scrutiny. He referred me to ""the evidence that changed his mind"" and it didn't look like Illuminati stuff or other crazies so I was pretty surprised. He said that that stuff shouldn't dictate our relationship but we could talk about it more if I wanted. This seemed pretty reasonable but I was still a little wary of the ""truther"" association.

I told one of my girlfriends about it and she got really concerned like I just told her that Dan strangled a puppy or something. I told her some of the arguments he made but she didn't even address them and said that I was getting deceived. Basically she said that the fact that he believes the conspiracy theories (which I thought was kind of unfair characterization of his position) is proof that he is of unsound mind. At this point I was really confused so I told her I needed some time to think about it.

How should I proceed? Is my friend right to where this is a big enough issue to end the relationship? Dan doesn't think so and says that he is willing to stay with me even if I don't accept the evidence, although seeing it from him perspective ""would make him so happy.""

I have a 3.9 GPA, and a 3.5 in the major, and","Background: I am a college student, in a Biomedical Engineering program at a school known for said program.  I am in my 3rd year of study, out of 5 (as the school has a 3 co-op cycle, meaning I am in school for Fall/Winter quarters, and then have a 6 month job internship, paid).  I'm also a white female, born in the US, so I don't have a huge advantage in terms of acceptance to medical school.

Over the past year I've been trying to figure out what I want to do after college. With what I have read, and the professors and students I have talked to, I realize the job possibilities post-undergraduate with no additional degree in Biomed are very few.  Most go on to graduate school, law school or in the vast majority of cases, medical school. Most of my classmates are in BME to up their chances of medical school acceptance, with the intentions of being a doctor of varying sorts.  Besides the fact that I need to take the MCAT, I know nothing about the process of applying.

I am extremely fortunate in that my parents will (to an extent) help me with some fees, but I expect to be taking out some loans in the case that I am accepted to medical school.  Right now I am more concerned with the ""getting in"" aspect.  

I am concentrating in neuroengineering, and I am intending a minor in psychology. Psych has always been of the utmost interest to me, since my family has a prevalence of mild-medium degrees of mental illness.  At the urging of my parents (both businesspeople), I went into engineering to achieve a ""technical base.""  It is not my intention to get a masters in any engineering field, because I feel my talents are exceedingly in the favor of another venue: psychiatry.

My boyfriend believes we should break up so that we don't end up hating each other. I feel that we can fix things, realizing now that much of the fault is mine.

I'm asking him to give me a chance to try, to stop blaming him, and to take responsibility for my own actions. 

He is torn and as am I. Because we both see the positive in breaking up, but we both want to stay together. We really care about each other, but we have a lot of really tough days where things from the past just haunt us. Sometimes I can be mean, but I want to let go of this resentment. He thinks it's a big picture thing keeping us down, whereas I see it as day to day hardships that can be conquered. Will this go away with work and love? Or would it be best to just end it now, knowing that we'll never overcome this?

I met a girl at work (not preferable, but whatever) who wants to hang out a lot. I mean, maybe three-times-a-week a lot. Like I spend most weekends with her, at least two nights. When we're at work, we're G-chatting, and at home, she's texting the fuck outta me.

In the past, I've been more likely to just write a girl off for rejecting me, but she didn't actually reject me.

He was going on and on about how great it was and how he didn't want to be woken up. My SO said he was jealous and he wishes he had more dreams like that with sexy women (like the ones his friend mentioned) so he has something to enjoy when he gets up. Something to ""look forward to"" as he put it.

It hurt my feelings. Mostly because even if he does feel that way, I'm offended he said it. I'm 5'7 and weighed 110 lbs when I got pregnant. Now I'm 125 lbs and feel like a lard. I've also haven't been looking that great. I'm exhausted and my hair/skin is doing weird things from hormones. Our sex life is really not there because it's really painful right now. 

I'm not sure if I should just say ""Yeah, I saw your text messages and they hurt my self esteem because I feel like an ugly, waddling cow"" or if I should just remember that he's allowed to have his fantasies and leave it alone. I guess it's not the fantasies as much as him openly saying it to someone. I don't know.

1695," Mum is bad with money, owes lots of money, has been letting my brother live in our house and not paying for it, and is starting to get behind on payments, and I want to move out and get my own place, but not if","So, my mum is kinda bad with money. Like, really, REALLY bad with money. She is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt thanks to an old house she bought and then stopped paying for completely, and she owes pretty much every company you could possibly think of more money than I can fathom. 

We moved out of our house a year ago and into a tiny apartment when the house finally got repossessed. Since my mum owed the electric company several hundred dollars, she convinced me to put the bill in my name, even though I had no job at the time. She said it would help me build credit and that she'd make sure it got paid on time, so, being just barely 18 and stupid, I believed her. 

Recently, things have gotten pretty bad at our house, with her letting my older brother move in and live for free and pretty much trash the place, and since I have a job now I was considering trying to get my own place. There's also the matter of her starting to get behind on payments, no matter how much I give her from my paychecks, so I'm worried about her racking up debt on me. I just was wondering, what should I do about the lights? And how would I bring it up to her? She gets a bit vicious at even the slightest mention of me being independent (she flipped when she heard I would start paying for my dogs' food) so I was wondering what the best way to broach the subject would be, if at all?

1696," I broke up with my girlfriend because we didn't spend much time together, but now I want her back, but not sure if I can wait a month to ask her again, and if I do, how to word it to her.","So I broke up with her because, at the time, I felt like I didn't really value our relationship since we hadn't spent that much time together recently, and we have already taken a one week break from each other during which I didn't miss her.

 When I broke up with her a week ago, I left the option on the table for us to get back together after volleyball season is over in a month, and she said maybe to that. But to be honest, I'm not sure if I can wait that long to ask her back out. What should I do?

1697," I have an apartment that I don't use very often, but my parents are paying for it and don't want me to move in with my boyfriend (who lives 5 minutes away) until at least a year has passed (or until marriage).","Hello reddit! So here's the situation: me and my boyfriend have been together for about one year. After graduating from college in May, I ended up in an apartment with a flexible lease (can end it with 60 days notice at any point throughout the year) in an apartment about 5 minutes away from my boyfriend's house. I have one roommate, a guy that graduated a couple years before me from the same school but wasn't someone I knew previously, and his dog, who barks every time I enter the apartment and I'm generally not crazy about. I've ended up spending 99% of my time at my boyfriend's place and sleep there every night, basically using the apartment as a large closet where I go to pick up or drop off my stuff sometimes. 

My boyfriend and I are very compatible and have had minimal issues ""living together"" as we have been the past few months. Only problem that could be more of an issue in the future is that he isn't the type to go out to bars or stay out late and I like to do that occasionally, but there's a bed in his basement and we've discussed that I could sleep there if I happen to be getting home way past his bedtime.

It seems like it would make sense for me to just move in with my boyfriend officially at this point and stop wasting money on the other apartment, but I know that one year isn't a very long time to have been together before making a big decision like that, especially since I'm so young. To add to that, my parents have told me that they would **not** be comfortable with me living with him and not having a backup situation in case something went wrong. 

I don't want to jump into this without thinking it through, but the current situation is stressing me out a lot and I'm ready for some sort of change. My boyfriend also thinks that I should move in with him (and is generally pushing it more than I am), but my parents still help me out financially and are very important to me, so I don't want to ignore their advice. Let me know what you think!

1698," I had a big urge to shit, but was late for my cleaning appointment. I held it until the pointy tool of death was in my mouth and let out a fart/shit combo that was a bad combo of rotten milk and eggs.","This happened on Wednesday fellow redditors, you time constraining fucks. 
Had my 6 month cleaning at the dentist today. Right before I left my apartment I realize I had to shit but I was running late, I could not afford to reschedule my appointment again (already rescheduled it twice before). 

So here I am, prairie dogging on the car ride there. I want to shit so bad but I have a fear of shitting in public places (my dumbass). I hold it until they call my name to go get my teeth cleaned. 

So, I'm getting my teeth scraped by the metal pokey tooth of death. I'm clenching my asscheeks trying to withhold my shit of a thousand suns. Suddenly I get this big burning pain sensation in my stomach, I realized I had a bowl of cereal before I left, I'm lactose intolerant. Fuck me in my poopy ass.

I had this big urging need to shit all of the sudden, and let out this massive fart/shit that smelled like rotten milk and eggs. I immediately clench and lift my head upwards in agonizing embarrassment. Bad choice.

The pointy park of the metal tool of death was still in my mouth, when I shot up clenching my shitty ass, it penetrated my gums in the back of my mouth and hung there like a fucking fish hook. I was a fucking fish.

I pulled it out and my dental assistant lady ran out of the room looking for a first aid kit.

There I was in my glory, bleeding mouth with shit pants running to the bathroom. I lock the door and shit my ever loving brains out. The sweet sweet relief.

I came out of the bathroom looking like a fucking cannibal shitter who smelled like farts and ass.

I left without finishing my cleaning. Needless to say I will be getting mg a new dentist.

1699," I feel like my heart is skipping a beat while running, but it doesn't hurt, just uncomfortable. It happens once or twice a run, but today it happened several times in a row. I slowed down and it stopped. Is it normal to","I'm a 31yr old female runner, been running since I was about 12yrs old. In the last few years I have been experiencing what I can only describe as a sort of spasm on my heart? Or at least it feels like it. It does not hurt, it just feels like my heart is skipping a beat while I'm running, and I do not get dizzy or short of breath or anything, just the uncomfortable spasm. In the past, it would happen once or twice during a run, but today, in the first two miles, it happened several times in a row. I just slowed down a bit, and eventually it stopped. I only finished 4 miles today, as I was concerned with maybe i'm pushing myself too hard? I dropped 7lbs since Christmas (125 to 118) and have been trying to get back down to between 110-115. (I'm 5'2 so this is normal weight for me) I've been on the verge of overweight for the last 2yrs, kind of just keeping it in check because my husband and I were trying to conceive for a while, and so I wasn't running as much, and was taking hormone shots, and blah blah blah.
